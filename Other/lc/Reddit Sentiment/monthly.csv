0,n27ms3n,it_all_falls_apart,i have a player who every session for the past 2+ years asks me what his spell attack bonus is and how his class works even though i've told him multiple times i've never played this class and it's his job to read the rules for it. i'm fine answering clarifying questions but god damn it's frustrating. this guy is in his 30's. 😑 ,['class'],1lvmytn,No one reads the rules anymore

i can't imagine being months in and not knowing how your character sheet works. 

i can understand where they're coming from, it can be a very intimidating hobby to start with cos it almost feels like you're doing homework to play your game, but once you're in it, i've found it very intuitive. patience seems to be key here and also making sure your players are aware of your frustrations.

4,n27h67c,LucielFairy,"as someone who has dm’d at many tables for one shots and campaigns since 2018, i can tell you… this never changes. most of the people i dm’d who came to my table didn’t see/listen to a dnd podcast beforehand, they were convinced to do it by a friend who most likely also don’t know the core rules, just the imaginative play. 

this can be frustrating at times. 

but i’ve learned to roll with it and always remind them of the rules and sit down with each player individually(if/when needed) to explain their class and even offer for them to try a different class if they’re not having as much fun as expected with the gameplay. 

for one of my players, they played two campaigns with me, nearly 3 years worth of sessions and she still couldn’t always remember how to attack or what to attack with. talk about frustrating, after showing her many, many times… it just doesn’t stick with some people. 

in short, i don’t expect a single person to know a single rule about dnd when they sit at my table and i’m ok with that. i’m happier knowing that i helped them along their dnd journey and hope they create many more characters and stories with the friends they made along the way :)",['class'],1lvmytn,No one reads the rules anymore

6,n27u44t,Southern_Courage_770,"i recently joined a campaign where it was agreed that we would be going 100% 2024 rules, phb only no ""backwards compatible"" races/backgrounds etc to ""try out"" the new rule systems and class features.  

several things have fundamentally changed in 2024 5e compared 2014 5e.  surprise, hiding, equipping weapons as part of an attack, etc.  some spell rules have changed, a few rather significantly. things that were vaguely left up to the dm now have actual defined rules.

i feel like i'm the only one at the table who has actually read the 2024 rules, or at least a ""here's the differences"" blog post.  almost every turn i am needing to remind the dm or another player ""no, that doesn't work like that anymore... here's the new rule.""  its to the point where i almost want to suggest going back to 2014 rules since no one cares to pay attention to the new ones.  the compendium is shared with all of them on roll20, so its not like they can use the ""but i don't wanna buy the book"" excuse.  there's also several online sources that compile the game rules for quick reference/lookup that they ignore.

there's also so much baggage from ""my old dm did it this way"" or ""but you can do that in bg3!"" because they never even read the 2014 rules in the first place.  like, if its not on their character sheet it doesn't exist.

8,n29t221,CUBE-0,"getting into dnd through a show or podcast is absolutely no excuse not to make an effort to understand the rules. i got into dnd because of the adventure zone, and as much as i love taz the mcelroys couldn't follow the rules to save their lives, not that they especially care too (and fair enough, it's their game), but as a player in my own right i want to know the rules. it's bizarre to me that people do just whatever. like why are you playing dnd if you don't know the rules? you aren't playing dnd. these types if people aren't playing dnd. they're playing calvinball and they're calling it dnd because they happened to have taken some vague inspiration from the aesthetics of dnd.

i don't expect people to know the more obscure rules, like the number of miles you can see from a high vantage point or how oversized weapons work, but they should understand the rules they directly interact with at least. reading the phb isn't a huge ask. when i was new i sucked, but i sucked trying and learning by asking questions, instead of sucking because i didn't care enough to read how to make attacks. and i think i was 17-18 when i first started playing so there's not even the ""younger than 25"" thing to go for, a lot of people just suck in general.

9,n29xz0h,swordgeo,"when it’s a new game system and people aren’t familiar, i’m okay with a bit of that.

here’s something my old 2e dm did to rein me in when i was a 10 year old playing a wizard my first time despite my dm advising me against it.

i say i’m going to cast x spell. he asks me what it does. i tell him i don’t know and start fumbling with the book. he tells me i can cast that spell my next turn if i know what it does. would i like to hit something with my stick or just pass turn?

suffice to say i read my spells quite thoroughly from there on out. ymmv

if a player refuses to learn the rules at all (not that they just need guidance and patience but rather they straight up refuse), do you really need that person at your table?

10,n2bia6r,devilish_oxygen,"i as a dm, actually love this with new players. it makes it more fun. it might be a little boring at first but the best way to do it is to just do a little run down dungeon. where you can teach the players what each stat does and what you need to do in order to cast some common spells. and instead of getting mad when someone doesnt know what to do, i guide them through and explain how it works. i also like to throw in the handbooks into the middle of the table, for if anyones interested in reading while they wait for others turns (they normally always are). dnd isnt just like any other board game, its not just flat rules. and yes, this takes longer. but the payoff is that you're not just building rule-followers, you're building engaged, curious players who *want* to know more. to me, that’s worth a few slowdowns

look, i’d rather have a table of excited newbies who don't know the rules and wanna have fun than a table of burnt out veterans who nitpick everything. i can teach the first group. the second just kills the vibe.

\*\*most people dont learn by reading the rulebook cover to cover, or they may not even understand the first 20 pages. they learn by seeing it applied, feeling the consequences, and getting excited when their spell lands or their idea works.\*\*

edit- i would also like to say, if you have a player or two who refuses to learn or just doesnt understand. you should let them describe what they wanna do and then you as the dm should do what they wanted for them (if you cant do this simple thing, maybe you're just a lazy dungeon master)",['spells'],1lvmytn,No one reads the rules anymore

12,n2fixp1,bd2999,"i do think this is true in my experience. to me it seems to be more of a situation where there are alot of casual fans. and giving them a book, physical or digital, is potentially daunting to do and feels like homework. particularly if you have not done it before. 

some people will get excited, but some will want to be a part of it and have fun but not care about the specifics going in. i know both sorts of players. the ones that are most engaged and ready to go tend to have read the books or the majority of them. the more casual are interested in the game but tend to fade in and out a bit more and lose focus easily. or rather get frustrated because they do not get how a class ability is different than a concentration spell for instance. it is still not usually a big deal but it does slow it down. 

it is a balance, a for me i would rather everyone play and have a good time more than anything. mixed bag for sure. i think if i had more in person games i would insist on players reading at least some of the sections, but it is harder online to do other than to just take people's word and hope for the best.",['class'],1lvmytn,No one reads the rules anymore
13,n27n3is,Agreeable_Speed9355,"dnd has always had rule lawyers and people who just want to role play with friends. 20 years ago, we had people who read the rules, studied them, and min maxed with prestige classes, etc. we also had folks who got the gist and were fine being corrected. 

i've read the 5e and 5.5 rules and have a pretty good idea of what to expect and how to run the game, but my dm has house rules like he doesn't use flanking, but has allowed me to use monk damage with improvised tavern brawler weapons, which i think is dm fiat and not actually raw. 

i think the game has been simplified or streamlined enough that rigorous study of the books isn't as important as it used to be, and enough of us have experience playing through multiple editions that we kind of just play the way that feels most right. of course, there is a lot of neat stuff in the books, but when you're playing your first or 2nd character, there isn't a lot of need to understand backgrounds and class features you don't have. new players always had a steep learning curve, but the best way to learn the game was by playing, not reading. nobody learns to swim by reading a book.","['weapons', 'class']",1lvmytn,No one reads the rules anymore

i would argue that the glory days were when james haeck was writing free encounters / adventure content every other day - as a dm, that made dnd beyond one of my favorite blogs to visit each week. but i imagine many players would be more interested in things like the class 101 guides, which have continued (since they are effective at selling books).

like suppose as a dm i want to give my player a charm which allows them to cast speak with dead five times. on paper, they can just write that down, maybe on a scrap piece of paper clipped to their sheet with five check boxes for them to fill in as they use the charm. or they can put it directly on the sheet. or they can make five copies of a speak with dead spell card. whatever helps them understand, remember, and use the feature. it's super easy and incredibly intuitive.

or maybe they're using a digital spreadsheet. okay, not as easy or intuitive to customize, but you can still input whatever text you want, resize and combine cells, add notes, that kind of thing. so you could have a block of cells dedicated to charms and stick a line for speak with dead with five check boxes in it, or add the text of the charm in the features and traits section of the character sheet and track the uses in the text of the feature, or whatever else works for that player.

or if we're using roll20, that's even less easy and intuitive to customize, but the player can still easily add the feature to the sheet directly at any time, including adding the spell to the character sheet and making a custom resource tracker to note the number of uses remaining.

or they could have a fillable pdf, which is pretty restrictive in where you can put stuff and how much stuff you can put there, but at least you can add whatever stuff you want. super easy to add the feature into the character sheet, and it can be edited as the charm gets used.

and then there's d&d beyond. how do you even begin to add such a thing to your character sheet? you can't just freely add features to your character sheet, but maybe you can at least scrounge through the manage spells button to add the spell itself, and just remember how you're allowed to use it? nope. it just won't let you add the spell. so we've got to make a homebrew feature, which means learning the d&d beyond homebrew system, which means there will probably be some trial and error because it's far from intuitive. and then we go back to the character sheet and find that we still can't add the charm? what's going on there? oh right, we need to go back to the character sheet settings and enable homebrew, and then hope that the system is working well enough to find and add the feature. yikes. and where do i track the number of uses remaining? do i have to edit the homebrew every time the charm gets used?

and that's not even getting into wrangling the 2014 and 2024 content, which is really annoying to deal with. plus the character sheets load pretty slowly, which as a player shouldn't be a big deal, but as a dm one of the things i like about digital tools is that i can see a live version of the player's sheet. if it takes a solid 5-10 seconds to load the page every time, that stalls the game a bit any time i want to sneakily check a passive perception or whatever.",['spells'],1lui08a,DnD Beyond vibe shift :(

66,n1rkiy3,AnOldAntiqueChair,"i know it’s kind of a nothingburger, but i think this should be said anyway… you probably shouldn’t have a boss able to use so many counterspells back-to-back in the same turn. those are actions. in the first place, counterspells are just sort of a way to steal the players’ thunder.

you want everyone to feel like they’re *accomplishing* something. unless you make it clear that the counterspelling is draining some sort of resource, you’re just making casters feel useless and bored.

also, rules-wise, you actually can’t use multiple spell slot spells in one turn. so, if your boss is playing the same game, he would only be able to use *one* counterspell and then no other magic, assuming you’re having him use spellslots and not just spells-as-abilities. note that cantrips are exempt, since they don’t use spellslots.",['spells'],1lt5n04,"""Congratulations Tank, you are truly a tank"""
67,n1q0vfe,Hungry_Bit775,"i always use the monster hunter homebrew method for boss fights: specific initiatives.
bosses don’t have action, bonus action, reaction, and movement per turn like a player character does. bosses get phases on a specific initiatives instead. for example…
initiative 20: crowd control effect or attack phase.

initiative 15: lair action phase.

initiative 10: movement or buff phase.

initiative 5: legendary ability or high level damage spell phase.

pc’s roll their initiatives to see how fast they are compared to the boss’s specific initiatives. this makes initiative rolls way more interesting since players will want to roll above a certain threshold in order to act before a specific phase. for the example above, warn players that a certain big damage ability or spell is coming in at initiative 5, and players will naturally want to work together to figure out how to stop it. and of course, if they ignore that initiative, the party gets summarily punished.

you can keep a specific initiative for like 2-3 rounds before changing it up.

i also like this boss fight method because it organizes boss’s spells, attacks, and abilities so that i don’t end up with analysis paralysis and make bad decisions for my boss monster (and end up inadvertently nerfing the fight).
aaaand, very importantly, this allows me to effectively empower my bbeg against certain meta strategies (counter spell spamming, incapacity crowd control spamming, etc) because i can make the decision to use the next initiative to either roll dice to get out of it or use legendary resistance *predictably* (and this is important). players then naturally learn when to use their counterspell or crowd control on the boss instead of spamming it, such as using a grapple before the boss goes into a movement phase, or using a hold person/monster before the big damage phase, or have a counter spell prepared before the big damage aoe spell or big crowd control spell.

69,n1uteqm,mercurae3,"the rules for casting multiple spells in a turn are kind of a mess imo. 2014 seemingly intended for you to only be able to cast one leveled spell per turn but there were loopholes. 2024 rewrote the pertinent rules to close some of them, but ended up opening others. the ""one leveled spell per turn"" is a common simplification but technically not raw in either 2014 or 2024. maybe they should have just made the ""one leveled spell per turn"" official since it's a super common misconception but seems to align with what's intended anyway.

>""2024 outright disallows multiple levelled spells in a turn.""

technically not exactly true. it doesn't allow casting using more than one **spell slot** in the same turn. if you have a way to cast a spell without burning a spell slot such as a racial or class ability or a magic item, then you can burn a spell slot for another spell in the same turn (obeying casting time restrictions). quicken spell still doesn't get around this as the 2024 version explicitly states you can't use your action for any level 1+ spell before or after using quicken spell to cast your bonus action level 1+ spell (it doesn't specify using spell slots, just the level of the spell being cast).

technically, there's a slight issue even in 2014 regarding somatic components. you would need both hands free, one to cast the original spell and one to cast counterspell. if you're a wizard holding a staff or wand in one hand with only one hand free for spellcasting, raw would be no counterspell. war caster and subtle spell both get around this.","['spells', 'class']",1lt5n04,"""Congratulations Tank, you are truly a tank"""

""the session is on x day"". and if someone can't come, especially with no warning or discussion, play without them.

""okay, mark off that spell slot as used. the spell hits the wand and immediately fizzles. the wand is made of wood. the wizard laughs at you."" and then end their turn. they want to act silly and cast on things you're clearly telling them aren't metal, then they can face the in-game consequences of burning a spell slot *and* wasting their turn.

the issues of not being serious i would address out of game. ""hey bill, i've noticed a few times that the party will be engaged in a serious situation/conversation and you try to make a joke/act silly. i understand that your character is a bit of a jokster, and you know i even have some jokes and fun things in the campaign, but there's also some serious things, and you need to pay attention to when the moment is serious and adjust to that moment. it's becoming frustrating to bother me and other players when i've planned a serious moment and you try to make it a joke.""

as an in-game consequence you could also have an annoyed npc cast something like silence, hold person, or even banishment on him if he's butting in on a conversation that's being had mainly between the npc and another pc.

even if a thief is invisible, they still have to get into the stall or behind the counter to where the merchandise is kept. that may involve climbing over a table loaded with merchandise or picking locks in a crowded alleyway. the good merchandise is probably kept in locked chests. and people will probably notice if an invisible creature picks up something on the table and it turns invisible too. in short, the theft should still be a challenge, even with invisibility.

also, if low-level magic is reasonably common in your world, alarm is a first level ritual that lasts eight hours.

what kind of stuff are they stealing? equipment? even if they get away with the theft now, later on they might be seen using a stolen weapon, for example (the shopkeeper will definitely know what is missing when they take inventory later). then word will spread through the criminal underworld, and soon an angry shopkeeper is hiring thugs and assassins to steal it back.

i’m not personally a fan of the “every shopkeeper is a retired level 20 adventurer” or “every shop is protected by ten layers of advanced magic” solutions. they’re immersion-breaking bandaids on problems that can be solved other ways, like reputation loss, or in extreme cases telling your players “can you not be murderhobos?”

that said, shops *should* have a level of protection that scales with the level of merchandise they handle. if magic is uncommon in your world, most shops won’t have magical defenses… but most shops won’t have anything worth stealing for any adventurer beyond level 3. sure you can go invisible and rob them blind, but you’ll just end up with twenty coils of rope and feel bad the next day when you see the broke peasant shopkeeper begging on the street.

meanwhile, shops that handle powerful magic items *can* be expected to have equally powerful magical defenses.",['spells'],1m5eqxs,"How do i prevent players from stealing without just being a bad dm saying ""you cant do that"""
88,n4bdbeh,General_Brooks,"if you’re ok with them stealing, then you just need to make clear to the players that this is risky and dangerous and you won’t shield them from logical consequences should they disastrously fail, up to and including character death.

if they still want to do it, you need to put in a series of logical security measures and consequences. if the party overcomes those, they’ll have deserved the win, and if they don’t, they’ll experience the consequences they knew they were risking.

if you have an undercity blackmarket which contains that much wealth, it’s clearly going to have security measures in place. it’ll be heavily guarded, with checks carried out at the entrance.

i’d suggest that everyone going in would be required to do so without weapons or any magical effects on them. it only takes 1 level 1 wizard repeatedly ritual casting detect magic to help enforce that, which is a pretty reasonable resource for such a wealthy criminal organisation to have. something as simple as a bead curtain helps to prevent invisible individuals from slipping through without being spotted.

alternative for future instances of ""my actions have consequences,"" magical traps. again, this is a black market. why are there not magical wards to prevent this very scenario? somebody casts disguise self or invisibility, a magical ward should immediately shut the spell down and cause the caster's hands to glow bright red even if hidden under fabric. maybe have an arcane glowing arrow pointing down at them from above so that there is no doubt who it was. make it super obvious and have them deal with whoever is running the market. another fun option: traps. those who frequent the market would know better than to try and steal from the market, but rookies and newcomers might not know that certain objects are left out as bait. some stalls might have items that are intentionally left in obscured locations that would be super easy to pocket even for a novice, or maybe there are a couple of stalls that are left unmanned as if the owner had to make a quick exit. if your players try to take any of this low hanging fruit they immediately trigger unseen sigils and runes that cast spells like hold person, alarm, etc, again things that make it super clear who they are and what they were trying to do. let them deal with the consequences.

you don't have to tell your players ""no"" when they want to do stupid things, you just have to know how to make them feel the full weight of their actions afterwards. stealing is frowned upon, and i'm sure that in a world full of magic, both common markets and black markets (especially black markets) have found ways to guard their wares. don't kill them, but make it cost more than they stood to gain.","['spells', 'weapons']",1m5eqxs,"How do i prevent players from stealing without just being a bad dm saying ""you cant do that"""

99,n4bfkmq,Overread2K,"ok so its important to remember that years of video games have taught people to steal anything that isn't bolted down to then sell to merchants (who will buy everything) to make the most coin. in many video games the penalties for stealing are either absent or very minor or easily got around with a few tricks. so it reinforces this attitude. 



now in your game this might well not the be the case and there are a good few ways you can teach your players that there are consequences

  
1) immediate - guards, spells, traps, pet mimics etc... basically a whole range of things can  cause an instant problem for your players if they try stealing. however this might not actually discourage them. now its a challenge for them and they will see it as a means to try and out-compete your protections. the stronger the protections the more they'll want the shiny thing! 

2) regional - steal too many things from the town/village and they might turn on them or get too hot. this can be a good way to teach greater consequences of their actions. however adventuring parties are used to travel and they might well just decide to up sticks and leave this town for another. now their challenge is to steal as much as they can before being forced to move onto the next random village/town.

this approach might dissuade them from stealing at large from very big/key settlements; but they'll still rob blind any smaller one

3) bigger consequences. so ultimately consider that the reason they steal is for loot and advantage. instant challenge can be ok but often is only going to be a wrist slap that they'll try and overcome or see as a challenge. so another harsher approach is to set them up for a big fail. 

this could be a few things

a) being arrested. overwhelming numbers/power forcing them to surrender and be charged. now they might try and escape their imprisonment, but at the very least this is where you could see them stripped of all their possessions. no handy ""oh we'll store all their stuff in this locker"" on the prison island. this could knock them right back to fighting with almost literal sticks and stones. they could even lose key quest items that they've gathered; key player items that are of importance to them and more.  
the bonus here is that regaining what they had could become the new focus for the party - though you might need to nudge them toward non-stealing methods if they go down the pathway of ""lets just steal it all back"". now you've got the possibility for a redemption arc in the story

note - if they've any party pets/hangers on losing them (or the potential of losing them) can sometimes be an even greater sting than losing gear.

b) being driven out of a whole kingdom/region and breaking the main quest. ergo whatever their primary objective, loot and exp and such was - its now entirely locked out to them. sure they aren't captured and they get to keep everything; but now they've gone and lost their main quest and have to escape. the punishment here is basically them not getting to complete the epic mega quest they were on and instead having to almost go find another. this one depends how invested they are - they need to be invested enough that its a burn to lose out; but not so much that it shatters their spirit to continue playing. of course where one door closes another opens so it gives you the dm a chance to spark them along a new story.",['spells'],1m5eqxs,"How do i prevent players from stealing without just being a bad dm saying ""you cant do that"""

125,n4da2vu,bapeery,"black markets likely curse their items (security tag) which breaks upon receiving payment. these curses would have tracking spells built in (air tag). there are almost certainly people or creatures paid to protect their assets who would not take kindly to being robbed (security). possibly teleportation magic, so stolen items return to the rightful owner at dawn if no money has changed hands. merchants at black markets have experienced theft countless times, especially given unsavory clientele and peers, they would almost certainly recognize deception and magic in use. glasses of true sight, animatic fields, zones of truth, and other wards are in place.

one of mine tried to use prestidigitation to change the color of copper into platinum. it worked initially, but shortly after a group of highly paid thugs came to extract payment. they didn’t care if it was in coin or blood. these are not simple bandits or mercenaries, they’re hardened, magically enhanced killers that are paid very well for their services and rely on their reputation for business. they’re a well known asset reacquisition guild and an unfortunate necessity. these people have scouted the party and bring heavy arms and direct counters to specifically combat them. two of my players ended up with broken knees in addition to losing the items. healers in town wouldn’t treat them after being warned of their unscrupulous ways and they had to travel somewhere else to get patched up. but this wasn’t enough.

a few short sessions later, they stole from a magical warehouse. after another brutal beating, and some jail time, they found their pictures in every major city shop as known vagabonds and paid an inconvenience fee for anything purchased if merchants would sell to them at all. it led to a whole plot line in which they needed to complete several tasks and pay a large sum to the guild to have the posters taken down. their reputation was ruined for a long time and had to earn respect through good deeds. the rogue opened an orphanage, the druid spent off days resolving a famine, the warlock (with help from their patron) rebuilt a temple destroyed by fire, and together they ended the slave trade entirely.

stealing from a vendor, especially from a black market, would be ground for retaliatory theft, kidnapping, and possibly assassination. imagine being harassed each time they settle for a short or long rest, no abilities get restored. use their own tactics against them. imagine waking up to find their gear was completely ransacked and now they have nothing. magical sleep, paralysis, and stuns are a thing. imagine each test results in a level of exhaustion instead of replenishing resources.

130,n4dgq2d,Separate_Lab9766,"the players are the main characters, but they’re not the *only* characters with intelligence and agency. don’t let them act like they’re the only people in the world who matter.

there are two ways to look at this: the in-world reason and the meta-game reason.

the meta-game reason says that this is a d&d game, and low risk should equal low reward. anything that is easy to steal should yield low gold and low xp. the item is a dud, or a decoy; or it has an unadvertised curse (what are they going to do, call the city watch and complain about an item they stole?).

the in-game reason says that where there is a pile of money, there’s a metaphorical dragon sitting on it. the vendors *know* they have expensive items and that they are surrounded by scofflaws and thieves; they will take precautions.

1. some kind of trap. enter the prohibited area, invisible or not, and take massive damage. dipping all the merchandise in sticky contact poison will deter most thieves.

2. decoy items. the items on display are not the actual items; they are illusions, replicas, or cheap magic mirrors so you see the item but the item isn’t actually here.

3. security feature. the magic sword they want to steal has an enchantment; it doesn’t function for anyone except the lawful owner. easy to steal, but if you do, it’s useless.

4. guardians. the expensive items are being held in the hands of golems; cheaper (but still valuable) items are with clay golems, str 20; but more expensive are held by iron golems, str 24. you want that item, you have to wrest it out of the hand of a golem.

5. anti-magic shell. the black market may be protected with an anti-magic field so *no* potions, items, or spells will work to assist with thievery.

6. honey trap. the only vendor in the black market that’s easy to steal from sells nothing but cursed items. you pick up an item without the proper magical gauntlet and the offending hand and arm starts to melt off, causing agonizing pain. the market subsidizes this stall as a security feature to flush out any would-thieves. at the sound of the thief’s first screams, the vendor offers to sell the anti-melting antidote for a reasonable price…

7. contract thievery. the vendor doesn’t own the item … yet. but he knows a guy who knows a guy, who is friends with a corrupt city guard, who knows the guy who built a back door into the vault where it’s kept, and for the right price he will procure it for you. so the item isn’t actually even here.",['spells'],1m5eqxs,"How do i prevent players from stealing without just being a bad dm saying ""you cant do that"""

start the next session with the players waking up to having glowing hands.  every hand that stole something is affected and each a different color ( blue, red and turquoise etc...).  the players find out this is the standard trap-spell put on all black market goods.  each vendor has a different color and activated the traps after they did inventory last night and found stuff missing.   now ever vendor stolen from has to send an assassins or enforcers to punish the thieves or they lose face.

* invisible imp that does not fight the party but follows them everywhere yelling - ""here are the thieves.  boss i found the thieves.  it's these ugly guys boss - come kill the thieves!""
* barmaid where they are staying notices the glowing hands tries to blackmail the party for an outrageous amount. (she can be the one who explains what the spell is and will tell everyone their hands are glowing if not paid off).
* giant troll with huge club wandering the street asking everyone if they have seen glowing hands.  he is too stupid to find them but is terrifying.  he has ""papers"" from mayor which say he is allowed in city.
* poison crossbow bolt from roof while walking down the street.  guy shoots then hides/runs.  keeps happening daily unless they catch him.
* note with exploding ruins slipped under door to their room.  note says ""no one steals from snegly the worm.  worse is comming!""
* a hit squad is waiting in the local tavern.  they wait for the party to sit down, then walk by and backstab every party member at the same time (all flat-footed) to start the fight.
* if camping outside town - at 3am fireballs from three directions hit - save or lose random items to the fire burning down the camp.
* exhausted pcs take off armor and go to bed.  one of the mattresses is a mimic.  he waits till everyone is sleeping.  don't say what is happening, just say everyone is woken by that one pc screaming and blood on the sheets.
* someone (thing?) in a black cloak left the party a dried black fish.  the tavern keeper has no more idea what it means then the party.

i'd either create a mall-cop that patrols the area with a combination of non-detection, see invisibility and detect magic always active. the rest of the spells are divination spells that allow him to predict how to stop theft and hold person for capture. maybe give him some magic glasses that provide him with true-sight, but only if you're prepared to lose them to the players. 

alternatively, i'd have a magic lamppost that casts see invisibility on anyone that touches it and speaks the correct passphrase. all the guards patrol in a way that ensures they pass by the lamppost in one-hour intervals to recast the spell on themselves. don't forget to narrate this happening at least once to give your players a chance to figure out what the guards are doing and abandon their initial plan. 

non-detection fully defeats both setups because all the relevant spells are divination. but it also has a very easy tell the black market can use to weed out customers if they really value security: you're immune to guidance, so a simple guidance-giving-greeter immediately knows when someone is affected by non-detection and can tell them to come back tomorrow when its worn off. 

the anti-magic field setup would be maximum security that ultimately interferes with product demonstrations. everyone is secure against non-detection+invisibility, but individual vendors can't use magic to protect their inventory and rogues can use their skills unimpeded unless you have guards everywhere. i'd use this setup for a bank or something akin to a high-end department store/mall.",['spells'],1m5eqxs,"How do i prevent players from stealing without just being a bad dm saying ""you cant do that"""

but also for locating objects they once had.

the pcs wake up the next morning and on the item they stole, they find a note and a black stone. the note says ""first time's free"".

the stone has two traps on it. first, a coating of poison, the second is a rune transfer that puts a tattoo on the handler's wrist. the poison (dc 18) drops con/wis saves and causes a mild headache. the rune transfer is a dc 20 con or wis save.

there is no information in the note about who it is from. if they try to go back to the black market and have the rune on any one of them, they are denied entry until they explain exactly what they did. exactly. which spells they used, why they did it, who they stole from. what they stole.

no vendor claims the items they try and return. they all say the same thing. ""first time's free"". but none of them will trade anymore, and the party are all watched very carefully.

no other shady or black market anywhere else will deal with them. they've been identified and marked. even if they remove the mark, they would need to constantly cast disguise self, constantly change their appearance, change their names, change their identity. they are on a list. ***the list***.

after a few months in game, someone approaches them. offer's them a black stone. doesn't say anything except ""first time's free"". this is just a black stone. no traps. if they refuse to take the stone, they are offered it again the next day. and again. and again. and again. until they accept it.

if they take the stone, they are told to go to a certain place at a certain time. that's all the messenger knows.

the meeting is in an ordinary setting, wherever you like. a well-spoken halfling with no guards and no threats tells the party that that there is an item that belongs to the obsidian stone. the party needs to retrieve it and take it to -insert city name-. no contacts are given. no timeframe. just a description of the item, the location, and a farewell.

the thieves guild will tell the party that ""the obsidian stone remembers"". the merchant's guild will tell them that ""the obsidian stone delivers"". the city/government officials tell the party that ""the obsidian stone promises"". and the beggars will tell the party that ""the obsidian stone pays"".

the party works for the obsidian stone now. there are no threats. it just is. some people take longer to accept reality than others. they have the patience of stone.

if the party takes too long to go after the item, they get approached by someone else with a black stone. at the meeting, they are told that the obsidian stone has obtained the item, the party did not. here is another item that belongs to the obsidian stone. rinse and repeat.

if the party ever refuses at a meeting, or does not turn up for a meeting after taking a stone, they are told that ""there is only one first time"" and then it's assassins. no warning. randomly, even in the middle of adventures or dungeon crawls.

one of the funnest characters i’ve played alongside was a dwarf fighter, my friend was actually working for a non-profit that advocated for workers rights at the time so the character’s main hook was that he tried to unionize his mine and ended up cast out and on the road. the guy played the entire rp amazing, constantly trying to get npcs to overthrow the corporate overlords and he even threw in a tongue in cheek flaw that he was absolutely terrified of ‘fat cats’ which our dm delightedly used to his advantage in a particularly fun session.

it's a bit hard to explain, but the bugbear twilight cleric, a lot of my roleplay time at the table is effectively just roleplaying the \*concept\*, this weird monster of the gloaming that's somewhere between a village shaman and a mysterious cryptid from the woods. and i love doing that, but it doesn't leave a lot of table time for me to actually get into what this guy is like as a person- or at least, it's probably not clear to the other players which of his traits are because of the concept and which are just specifically him. 

whereas if you play 'jonathan van normalguy', human cleric of pelor, not only does everyone immediately get that concept because we've seen it a bunch of times before, but it's very clear to everyone what traits of his are because he's a cleric (prays to pelor, sun spells, crushing undead), and which ones are his actual personality (smoking habit that's his one vice, journals every evening, actually really likes rough sleeping cause he finds the temple life stifling and claustrophobic).","['spells', 'class']",1m0ktp7,"My Friend Refuses To Play Official subclasses Because they aren't ""Unique"""

i recommend, firstly talking to him directly (not randos on reddit). then talk about different possibilities. for example, he struggles with spellcasting recommend a more straight forward class like a rogue, he can still get a lot of roleplay from the most boring human fighters.   
another thing, if it’s completely extreme maybe consider different system or table. but that’s only if you’re not happy playing together. he might be happier if he finds a table where the main goal is the same as his, but he may not find it. and sure there are better systems with less rules and combat, but he like many others might not wanna learn something new. seems like you’re all okay playing together and this is just a wrinkle. talk to him about the first parts, different types of players can and should play together to build a complete game, but if it feels appropriate tell him to experiment. not leave the group but check a couple of pther playstyles it seems he might enjoy. if for no other reason, just because the more rpg the better.

4) have his spells fizzle and waste his slots when he misuses them, tell him he mixed up somatic and material components with other spells, and therefore his character infused the wrong magic into the wrong stuff, causing the spell energy to be expended but the spell to not work right (also consider rolling on the wild magic table when he does this, as the confusion causes irritation to the weave)

208,n2097o1,Zippy_Da_Mew,"i feel this. i’m not a dm, but there are two players in my group who aren’t very good. we’ve been playing for 2-3 years now and person a still forgets how to calculate weapon attacks and damage. he’ll also try to play squishy spellcasters and then stick to melee range with them. he has done this with a bard, sorcerer, wizard, and a druid.  he constantly wastes spells too by using them in situations they aren’t useful for, no longer needed in, or completely misunderstanding what they do (or just not fully reading them). nearly every fight he either goes down or nearly goes down. it’d be one thing if he was trying to build into some niche melee magic build, but the spells and subclasses he picks don’t do that at all. it’s like he picks spells and abilities that are theoretically very good, but then can’t position, can’t read, can’t remember, and refuses to change. this same person also spent a whole campaign running away from the group without telling anyone in the party where he was going and then he (player) would be upset that we wouldn’t keep traveling without him after waking up to see he’s not at the camp with us, didn’t tell anyone he was leaving, and didn’t leave a note. as far as we know he was kidnapped. he also won’t say he’s doing something or will very poorly describe what he is doing to the point everyone else will be on the same page on what we think he’s trying to do and then he’ll get upset that “nobody listened to him” when he then describes a completely different thing or adds a detail he never previously mentioned. it’s so bad that in our first campaign the dm had to give him literal plot armor for his character to wear. armor that would bring him back up to full hp after hitting zero once per long rest. the kicker? he would lose the first life super fast and then still get very low or go down again in he fight. this was a paladin btw…

person b can’t survive anything to save his life, which is so bizarre considering most of his characters are fighters, barbarians, and other bulky/tanky options. we had one campaign where he lived all the way through. in our last campaign (before a tpk) he went through like 5 characters by the time we were level 9. this object with a magic rune on it that explodes when interacted with? i’m gonna keep punching it because it has to run out eventually. the biggest enemy in the fight? i’m gonna run to them by myself and leave everyone else to deal with everything else. the giant that’s minding its own business? i can take it in a fight. it’s like he’s completely incapable of thinking things through. he wants to chase down anything and everything that tries to run. he wants to fight literally everything with a stat block. in our current campaign we are only a few sessions in. three to be exact. his first character died in the second session. how? well let me set the scene. the dm had warned everyone (mostly the one who always dies) that there would be a dragon making an appearance in the story and we may or may not get into a fight with it. but that it was going to be nerfed and would try to leave after taking so much damage or getting crit, so it shouldn’t be too bad if we played smart. well the dragon went to leave and player b decides he doesn’t want it to run and basically goads it into coming back. everyone, including the dm, kept urging him to let us redact that because it would kill all of us and we are only 2 sessions in. he said he didn’t want to because he would rather live the consequences of his actions. we started yelling at him that it wouldn’t just be him, it would be all of us. all of the characters we just recently made and like would be dead. all the working the dm had put in would go to waste before anything has even happened yet. he reluctantly agreed to redact goading the dragon into returning. he then admitted he just doesn’t like it when any enemy tries to run away and he isn’t able to kill it. as if he wasn’t already informed that’s what would happen in this fight (which he said he had already forgotten) and that it wasn’t a literal dragon. so you might think he lived right? wrong. the dm presented another enemy and laid it out that someone else was going to fight him as they both appeared to be much stronger than us. person b? he decided that being outright told multiple times that this enemy was stronger than us, being advised by the dm to let this other person handle the fight, and being told he would have 1v1 him without any assistance wasn’t a dealbreaker for him to fight this random guy. he died in one turn. after the session he admitted that after making these decisions (before the actual consequences hit) he realized they were going to end poorly, but somehow he isn’t capable of thinking that through before making them despite everyone at the table explaining it before he even makes the decision in the first place. session 3 rolls around, he has a new character. we had one small fight that went well and then a larger fight (semi-ambush). as usual he tried to 1v1 the biggest, strongest enemy there and got himself outright killed. he hates when his characters die and struggles to make new characters he likes, but never seems to learn his lesson. he complains that he wants more complex combat that doesn’t revolve solely around killing all the enemies, yet that’s the only thing he’ll ever consider trying to do.

then instead of having him roll a new character. hand him an optimized barbarian (or other strictly martial class), with a rich rp background and strong story hooks with the party. no more long breaks for spell choices, a focus on what the player is already good at role play. (if you really wanna make the rest of the party like the character, give them some homebrew ""shamman feat"" where each long rest they can brew a # of potions of healing = to proficiency bonus so they act as a low mechanics party healer too)

(dm protip: easiest way to make this not feel like railroading, is to introduce the character as a badass npc a session or so before the pc's death, then after they have died, you can casually ask if they want to play that bad ass npc? it will feel like a natural inroad for a pc to re-enter the story, viola no railroad.... the illusion of choice; a dm's sonic screwdriver)

finally by your own admittion this pc is fun to rp with. i don't think you need much of anything else to have a fun table dynamic. remember the rules are meant to serve the story you as the dm and your friends (the players) are trying to tell. if the rules get in the way of that story in anyway, change them. alter them, edit, cut, chop, splice, omit, ignore, download, retcon, or rebalance, retool, and homebrew as necessary. you forget your place; you are the dm. god of gods at your table. and if they won't respect your power then certainly, they should fear it!

compare that to the other concepts for monk which are all fairly unique apart from open hand that is there to be the 'monk monk'.

in every consumer product industry, there are times when the bean counters are put in charge of the company's direction, and it always plays out the same way. d&d is no different: they were put in charge before 4e and it's been the same old story all over again, taking a successful product and wringing every last dollar out of it along with everything that made it successful in the first place.

i sometimes talk to my dad about what's been going on even though he knows nothing about games, and he just nods and says he's seen the same trend a thousand times.

1. product is expensive, unwieldy, unpolished, still in alpha/beta.
2. product proves useful, starts getting a consumer base that can fund its refinement.
3. funds are still going to the product and its team, so the engineers can go crazy with new designs, creating the basic models for most consumers but also cutting-edge top-of-the-line bonus features for those who want more out of it.

but then you get to something like ""tattoo monk"" and it's like, that's just...not a character archetype tho? it's an aesthetic. it's like making ""cigar chomper"" a fighter class. it's just a cool look, but not broad enough to fit a host of characters or mechanics. for the existing subclasses, you can get multiple kinds of characters under them, such as with the swash being both a rough-and-tumble pirate, a rowdy noble's son, a princely duelist, etc. meanwhile a ""guy with tattoos"" subclass doesn't invoke any character type, and is just ""you have magical tattoos"" is where the idea starts and ends. now obviously you can make any character within this concept, but honestly it seems like it'd just be better to make the tattoos themselves into a magic item instead.

all that to say is that basically all the **main** class fantasies have already been fulfilled. like, the kinda of homebrew classes people make are just ""different name for an existing class or subclass"", a witch is literally just a warlock or wizard. an oracle is just a cleric or divination wizard. a shaman is literally just a cleric or druid. etc. they're just these classes but with different aesthetics, which is free to add for yourself.",['class'],1lo94gn,I'm worried about how divorced mechanics and thematics are becoming in this game with the recent UA drops.

278,n12zp1o,Speciou5,"it solves one of the problems but not all. the spell is still pretty bad to base the entire ranger identity on. compare to other classes that have smite, sneak attack, flurry of blows, rage, action surge, etc. that are always good.

unlike warlocks with hex, rangers can weaponize their bonus action to attack very easily with either the drizzt inspired dual wield build or with hand crossbows with crossbow expert.

bonus action attacking is just better than using this spell once you hit level 4, especially once you try it in play and realize the targets keep dying and you have to keep reapplying it.

the spell is fine if you're level 3 and not doing something else, but there's no good reason to cast it in a long campaign where the ranger will level up.

i think it's still a step in the right direction, but dungeon dudes tackled it better by giving more features to hunter's mark from levels.

divine smite also uses your ba and a first-level spell slot for way less efficeincy than this new version of hm. even counting the use of your ba for the spell on your first turn of casting (losing out on 2 attacks) and missing half your attacks, you will outpace the damage of divine smite by turn 2 of having hm active. paladins do have divine favour for an extra 1d4 on attacks for a minute, but do not have much in the way of damaging concentration spells until higher levels. 

it's difficult to compare the two classes without doing a full breakdown as paladins have more defense-focused abilities, but i've seen many people analyze different hm modifications and the general consensus is that having it in conjunction with other concentration spells makes rangers too powerful before tier 3 play. i personally think the best option is to rebuild the feature to make it more balanced and synergize better with the rest of the ranger toolkit.",['spells'],1lqa17r,[OC] The simplest way to fix the Hunters Mark problem...

320,n3coatk,LordJebusVII,"i have a homebrew rule where each time you die, your death count goes up by one. revivify works as normal but doesn't prevent it from counting as a death. for all other resurrection spells you have to roll against a dc equal to your death count. if you fail, the spell fails and can't be tried again until your soul has returned. you can still try again with a different spell but obviously the cost will be higher for more powerful spells. this rule means that even a silly death that you are immediately revived from has a permanent impact for the rest of the campaign and makes every future death more risky. 

the actual impact is low, in 2 years we have 1 pc up to a death count of 3, but there is a much more urgent rush to heal before 3 failed death saves and a bigger rush to revivify rather than risk a failed raise dead. it's certainly more psychological than any practical difference but that was my intention. it's supposed to make death feel impactful without making big balance changes.",['spells'],1m0wbvl,"As a player, I can't feel the weight of death anymore"
321,n3cra2r,Robotic_space_camel,"at our table the revivify-type spells all focus around opening your body up for the soul to return and animate it again. any number of things could prevent that (e.g. previous deal with a devil for ownership of said soul, curse on the body preventing a soul from entering again, a magic item such as a ring of mind shield taking the soul first), and there is the aspect of the soul being willing and able to return in the first place. generally, heroic characters will be headed towards a good place upon death, and a character who was tortured in life with the deaths of others may not want to return once they are reunited with, say, the family they lost in a war during their younger years. you could opt for a similar explanation for particularly evil characters being given their rewards by their evil gods or perhaps being trapped in torment for their transgressions. 

for our game, the spells involve a ritual in which physical offerings and direct appeals to the soul are made to coax or empower them to return to the mortal plane from wherever they have found themselves. a barbarian, for instance, could perhaps be coaxed back with the presentation of their favored weapon, or a bard could be lured back with a performance of an unfinished song. the strength of the offerings and appeals feed into a single dice roll that determines the souls willingness and ability to return. if the dice roll well, the spell continues as normal. if not, the spell fails and nothing short of a wish can bring the character back. the rolls start off easy enough, but subsequent resurrection scar the body and soul and make each additional one more likely to fail. by the third resurrection, you’ll pretty much need a nat 20 to be brought back again. 

doing it this way still allows some dm fiat to allow resurrections for stupid mistakes or when the party makes a tactical error for a new opponent, but it does still feel real, as even the first offense does carry the risk that a bad roll could lock the character out of the game for good. characters who’ve been resurrected before or otherwise know that their souls are spoken for will also have that weight on their minds that their own death is more likely to be permanent, which makes the stakes higher as the game progresses.",['spells'],1m0wbvl,"As a player, I can't feel the weight of death anymore"

which brings me to my answer, which isn’t great when you are only a player: the setting has to account for it.

that is, the world where things happen has to have something about it that takes into account the presence of magic that can restore people to life in some way. that doesn’t mean it has to be made harder, it can just as easily be easier or more common.

but the issue isn’t really that there is the ability to bring folks back, it is that it doesn’t feel like the stakes are all that high — you get killed, you come back to life and go teach that asshole who killed you a lesson.

stakes are high when you have something to lose, though — something to which there is an emotional attachment or a specific necessity. so even in worlds where the magic is pretty matter of fact, there are still things that are cared about that can be lost.

as a player, one of the things to consider is the deciding what matters that much to a pc. it might be a family, or a kingdom, or an old ranch that the local baron is trying to steal through the use of high taxes so that the party has to organize an entire fundraiser to raise the money — or maybe raid the baron’s home and haul his ass out to a dungeon.

those might sound like low stakes, or a set up for an 80’s romantic comedy, but when you are playing the character, those stakes matter to you as a player to the degree you de die they matter.

if life or death are the only stakes that entice you to play, then when a pc dies, don’t let them be brought back (all the spells for it require consent).

tear up the sheet and start a new pc.  i do suggest talking to your dm, but i mean, ultimately, there is a reason that video games let you come back from the dead instead of making you start a new character.",['spells'],1m0wbvl,"As a player, I can't feel the weight of death anymore"
328,n3ddos0,ThatMerri,"i've handled it three different ways in my own games.

first is the **logical extreme**: when diamonds are required for reviving people, the nobility - that is to say, the people who have the most to gain or lose when death sticks due to rules of succession - immediately place a stranglehold on diamonds.  it's not ""the party can get some at a mark-up"", it's ""there are no diamonds"".  absolutely none.  the diamond trade is a taboo. because the entirety of resurrection is monopolized by the rich and powerful noble castes, and they do not share it with anyone.  if the party tries to buy any, they're instantly on a watch list.  if a mage gets powerful enough to start materializing diamonds via magic, that mage is immediately headhunted - either to be employed by a noble house or outright assassinated.  if a diamond deposit is discovered, nobles will start wars to secure it by any means necessary.  near-genocides have broken out against dwarven strongholds and drow underdark cities in the effort to seize subterranean neighbors' diamonds.

this also has the side-effect that other spells that require diamonds become totally inaccessible.  so no chromatic orb, no glyph of warding, no clone, etc.  wizards and liches jealously guard their personal reserves of diamonds required for their spells, and those who refuse to hand over their diamonds to the nobility are branded as enemies of the kingdom.  most adventuring parties are sent into dungeon dives and to fight dragons not because it's good for the realm, but because they've been hired by nobles hoping to scrounge up more diamonds.  it also builds a fundamental social imbalance into the setting, where it's no longer a case of ""death is temporary"" as it is ""only the poor die"".  death is very real and very permanent for anyone not part of the highest noble castes.

second is the **rarity of divinity**: simply that there should not be people capable of casting revivify or higher all that readily in the first place.  clerics, paladins, and druids are extremely rare - they're literally chosen by otherworldly forces to represent their will within the world, and they're generally given a purpose to pursue.  that's not something that you just find hanging around on every street and tavern bar.  so while healing magic might be available to the masses in some measure at temples, someone who can actually raise the dead because they've got a direct line to the powers-that-be is the stuff of legends.  if you've got some in your party, neat, but they should be the only ones around and everyone should acknowledge ""*oh shit, if these guys are bouncing around doing stuff, it means something big is going down in the near future*"".  also, if your party cleric goes down in a battle, good luck getting them back up again if the only other cleric capable of raising the dead is a continent away in a far-flung monastery.

third is **life insurance**: there's always a fate worse than death.  but whenever there's the capacity for bringing people back from the dead with magic and the other two scenarios don't apply, then someone is going to make resurrection a commodity.  i've had a character establish a ""life insurance policy"" where she paid a group a lot of money up-front that, in the event of her death, they would be magically alerted and set out to recover her body (and belongings, if possible), and revive her from the dead.  in the instance that a body couldn't be recovered, she'd given them enough flesh to manage a clone or similar higher-tier resurrection.  so while she didn't have to worry about dying for good, she did have to worry about:

a) potentially losing all her valuable and likely priceless equipment,

b) the consequences of failing whatever it was she was doing, which was likely very important and time-sensitive, and

c) the potentially exorbitant costs and debt that can readily come from such an insurance policy.

there's a lot of fates worse than death, and being stuck in debt to a loan shark that deals in souls, yet is not a devil, is pretty bad.",['spells'],1m0wbvl,"As a player, I can't feel the weight of death anymore"

also, encounters on the run. if every fight, the party is walking into a room and killing whatever’s in that room, anyone who goes down can easily be picked up. but if the party is fighting while, say, retreating from an impending flood, or running to the entrance of the dungeon as it starts to collapse on top of them, or chasing an escaping villain, or escorting a group of fleeing npcs that aren’t stopping for shit, that makes it a lot harder if not impossible to pick up and rescue downed players. action setpieces where the party is on the move can really up the stakes and change the dynamics of combat.",['spells'],1m0wbvl,"As a player, I can't feel the weight of death anymore"

each revival spell used, the dc increases by 2. so the next time you die, the dc increases to 12. and so on. so regardless of whether it works or not, any attempt to bring back a player increases the risk of perma death in the future. this is how you can treat death seriously while also toting around plenty of diamonds for resurrection spells.",['spells'],1m0wbvl,"As a player, I can't feel the weight of death anymore"
331,n3dqwy1,Agsded009,"just remove the spells if you dont want rez. but the game balances this already if your not handing out diamonds like rock candy. reviving folks is already a rare thing, its not hard to believe diamonds are rarer than they are in our world because gods during the old age of wars probably ate them all. people have a tendancy to over use nonrenewable resources. so by the time the pcs get there you might see 1 diamond and its usually a bad sign if the party has 1.

the church of sianna, the goddess of undeath, actively does this sort of thing.  they refer to those raised as 'reborn', and venerate them.  their entire church doctrine is that sianna must be killed, so that she can be raised again in her true form.

in this case,  all spells which allow the target to live again after having failed a death save, regardless of time intervals between the failed save and the revival, has a chance of manifesting some consequence on the plane where the spell took place. this also includes spells of necromantic divination, like speak with dead.

the consequence can be any variation between instantaneous or delayed in manifesting, large or small in area, intense or mild in effect, of a duration proportional to the power of the spell. 

i guess you can say the table i use is the gothic variation of the one for wild magic, because while the table of effects are as random, the collateral damage they can inflict are very real and linked to the subversion of death.

these can range from inconveniences (a minor curse causing all plant life nearby to wither and die) to being unable to recover hit points without magic (or worse,  the use of inverse healing), to sometime instantly transforming into an undead type of a challenge rating equal to the victim's effective class level...or absolutely nothing happening. 

needless to say, terrible things happen if a caster fails a concentration check during the casting... 

as a result, my players approach the prospect of combat differently, with tacticians assessing whether individual members of the party will need to make death saves during combat with any given opposing force.

383,n3aha32,Itomon,"there's a specific rule that says ""specific beats general"". so, by definition, anything that feels like an exception should be noted as a rule anywhere in the game.

since there is zero examples of spells that have an area which allows for the area or its effects to be moved **without being in the spell's description**, assuming this one is an exception wiithout a text saying so would break the first rule entirely.

in conclusion: unless specified otherwise, the phantasm is confined to the 10-foot cube of the spell's area.

(...) also, phantasmal force isn't being cast on a creature or object. it is an illusion that occupies the spell's area but only affects a creature of your choice - so the ""target"" is for the saving throw to avoid seeing the illusion, not the creation of the illusion in itself. here is the spell's text from 2024 phb, page 304

>you attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a creature you can see within range. the target makes an intelligence saving throw. on a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature or other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. the phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli.

>(...) while affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real and rationalize any illogical outcomes from interacting with it. for example, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists and something else caused it to fall.

>an affected target can even take damage from the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous creature or hazard. on each of your turns, such a phantasm can deal 2d8 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm. the target perceives the damage as type appropriate to the illusion

i fail to see where in the spell's description the area is attached to an object or creature, or that the spell's area is mobile in any capacity. you're free to interpret otherwise, but afaik raw disagrees with this statement that these spells can be moved after cast

**most importantly, spells' limitations are to help give the game balance**, so the best way to interpret it (raw or rai) is to consider if you believe this is reasonable or not for an illusion spell. i'd argue that as a level 2 illusion, being stationary is on par with what a level 2 illusion should do, so i'd rule against the ability of dealing damage outside the spell's area

384,n3bigqi,Thelynxer,"interposing hand is far from just cover. it effectually prevents melee attacks against you from a target, unless they have like 15 foot reach or strength of 26 or higher.

forceful hand is doing essentially what telekinesis does, yeah, but it's a bonus action, the same level spell, *and* does far more than just push someone. and it's not always about *you* getting away. sometimes it's about keeping the enemy away from someone else, or within range of someone else. thunderwave is only 10 foot knock back, and you have to already be up close to the enemy. i'm often using forceful hand before it gets to that point. 

all spells are all situational. hypnotic pattern is a big radius, so it can be troublesome to not hit allies, same with slow, same with web, same with sleet storm. wall of force you can't even move. not all problems call for aoe solutions. and animate objects is a fantastic spell, but is also generally a damage spell.

386,n3b7mm0,sens249,"that’s an unfair analysis at best.

first, you aren’t just taking turns away, you are also controlling them to an extent. forcing a backline creature to approach the frontline, forcing a backline creature or melee creature to flee (potentially taking it out for 2 rounds if you can kite it enough that it needs to dash to get back into the fight), forcing a powerful weapon user to drop their weapon (which you can steal to nerf their attacks), forcing an enemy prone to give your melee allies advantage. all of these go above and beyond taking away the turn.

next, a 1:1 trade is not at all a bad trade. a ton of actions in combat are way worse than that. virtually any damage action that doesn’t one-shot an enemy is equivalent, any healing or defensive spell is equivalent. it’s not just taking away a turn, it’s dividing the enemy force to make the next round easier. it’s very similar to how wall of force works. you block a couple enemies from taking turns so that you can fight a smaller set of enemies, and then you fight the ones that were blocked. 

the biggest thing you’re not considering though is that… it isn’t 1:1 at all. even if you only consider the  turn-denial. because it’s a non-concentration spell. you are already (or should be) concentrating on another powerful spell. you simply staying alive and keeping concentration is a contribution to the fight in its own right. there’s a reason why it’s a viable strategy for druid or cleric to cast a concentration spell and then literally just dodge, hide, or run away in some way simply to just keep the concentration spell up. command is a spell that can stack on top of that power, and if you look at non-concentration spells, command is one of the strongest ones (imo the strongest for its level).

finally, all of this is looking at it as a first level spell, but it has incredible upcasting too. raulothim’s psychic lance is a great spell, it incapacitates an enemy and targets a reliable save. but a 4th level command hits 4 creatures. that is potentially a 4:1 action efficacy, more when you consider the ongoing power of your concentration spell, and more when you consider the control your actual command exerts over them. obviously you’re not going to get all of them usually, but when you hit several creatures like that you’re usually going to get like 2-3. but any spell that can completely take away turns on top of your concentration spell is powerful. and there very few others that can do that. to me any spell that can allow a wizard to get 1:1 action trades while they’re also concentrating on another spell is powerful, but i believe command is better than that even.

oh, and i didn’t even mention how it can provoke opportunity attack for your allies and summons.",['spells'],1m08slz,What’s an “overpowered” spell you’ll always allow because it’s just too fun?
387,n3blkfz,sens249,"against one melee creature yes it’s good. but so is just, fly or levitate or something. melee creatures aren’t really hard to completely neuter. 

telekinesis doesn’t push enemies away, it’s a restrain that avoids legendary resistances. bigby’s hand can’t restrain it can only move and grapple.

your argument about big aoe’s being hard to place… that’s why no frontline is the best frontline, melee sucks (especially as a caster like a cleric casting spirit guardians), and initiative is powerful. i take gift of alacrity when i play melee martials purely to give it to the control caster so they can cast their spells before i run in.

order cleric like you mentioned have very few control spells, and no aoe spells that would be a problem. all of their spells allow you to sculpt enemies and target exactly who you want, like command, hold person, slow, banishment. it’s not until 6th level spells with blade barrier that you actually have a good spell that can get in the way of martials. so i don’t really see an issue 🤷‍♂️",['spells'],1m08slz,What’s an “overpowered” spell you’ll always allow because it’s just too fun?

right, healing word is only good when an ally is down, in which case it is always better than command.

attacking and guiding bolt do *damage* which might outright eliminate an npc, moving the action economy decisively in the party's favor.  moreover, guiding bolt provides advantage to *any* allied character who can benefit from it.  command *can* provide advantage to an allied character *assuming* the character comes between the caster and target in the initiative order (otherwise they just stand up and the caster has wasted their action on ""grovel"").  guiding bolt will be more reliable at giving advantage to a rogue specifically, which is who you want to have it.

i do rate damage as pretty important because it represents progress towards moving the action economy in the players' favor.

i'd mention that part of our issue may be that i never read the ""flee"" command as taking away the opponent's action but it could reasonably be read that way (requiring them to take the ""dash"" action), in which case i think the ""flee"" command in particular might sometimes be worthwhile.

405,mzukvhv,LiathS,"thank you!! ;w;

not at all! drawing spell effects is somewhat out of my usual comfort zone, but i go with the logic of, ""you can't edit a blank canvas"", in a sense, if i am stuck and not sure what i want, i either start drawing anyway, in this case, random shapes of what spells might look like without any references, and start changing things up sort of intuitively; or i first decide what sort of general concepts i wanna go for. 

for ignis, i wanted some spells to have diamon shapes (like his tail) or at least have a general sharpness to them, i wanted them to remind me of something dangerous and difficult to contain, like flames (even if the spell itself isn't a fire type), and a color palette, which i wanted to mainly keep purple (but deciding on exact shades also took a while ngl). in summary i wanted it to look like dangerous purple chaos fire. when you have those keywords for the mood, they can already guide you for how these spells might appear, especially their core shapes. for me, chaos and fire both meant that any shapes i decided for a spell would in some way be disrupting the base shapes.

when it comes to vfxs, not only the shape of the source but the trail/aoe matters as well. just knowing if the spell impacts a wide area or is pinpoint precise in addition helps determine a shape. for example, lets take a barrier. it's usually depicted as a circle or a dome, so you already have a default shape you can go for. now its the matter of applying the properties you decided beforehand. chaos for me that meant that it would appear like it isn't whole, but rather a shifting mass that uses a dome like a path to move across, and even in an offset around it. a mage hand is still a hand, but for ignis it would also look somewhat demonic   (lore+tiefling), with sharp claws that still end like flames. a projectile (firebolt, magic missle, whatever) would resemble a fire in it that it's center would look the brightest, with a darker trail behind it. chaos allows me to break any rules i decide beforehand. i think you get the idea.

i personally have trouble actually envisioning things in my mind (probably some level of aphantasia), so trying to work of off concepts and ideas beforehand to collect references that show me how a thing even looks like helps a lot.

i do hope this help you out with your own art, and your druid! if there is anything specific to take away from his, i really do recommend just to fill up that canvas with whatever first comes to mind when you think of the concepts tied to your oc, be it a list of words or actual sketches. and it becomes easier from there.

415,n2zkxiv,HeroVersus,"is this homebrew? if so, a character trait might be applying different effects to your spells. as an example, fire bolt is a pretty basic cantrip. throw fire, hurt enemy. however in the hands of someone who maybe didn’t pay full attention in their freshman year at waterdeep wizard academy, instead its smaller but faster. the fundamental facets of the spell adjust as a result of a less structured learning (i.e. sorcerers and their whole schtick), but as a result the spells are unique in their utility. a faster spell is harder to dodge, meaning an enemy might have to make a dc13 instead of a dc10 saving roll. a smaller spell can be used to attack through certain obstructions that a larger spell could not (like firing through the bars of a cell). however, because it is smaller and less potent, it probably has a smaller range and less power, only causing 1d6 damage instead of 1d10.

you can use this concept to further your idea of free will stealing via spells like hypnotic pattern, confusion, suggestion, command, and so on. so like normally, command is just that, a command. drop your weapon, turn three times, stroke a pose! however, for someone who didn’t get proper training, the effect might instead have limited (but very powerful) commands that you can manage to do. this could translate to having a higher dc for breaking out of the command, as an example, but at the cost of having fewer command options to choose from.

suggestion can get really interesting with that concept because that’s more of a subconscious goading than a direct instruction. as such, you can have your character influence certain facets of the mentality but be better at it, such as suggesting to someone you can be trusted or to follow your idea.

valley girl is ditzy, meaning their ends typically have very roundabout means. you get your result, but it’s a lot more convoluted than it needs to be. they’ll also be a creature of spontaneity if you’re being evil; they don’t scheme or plan beyond some grand gesture or goal, but when opportunity presents itself they’re quick to uptake on it, for better or worse.

for 1st level spells you could take, charm person is a very obvious choice (target regards you as a friendly acquaintance for 1 hour). if you do decide to go for sorcerer over wizard, divine sorcerers can take the spell command (you speak a 1 word command, target spends the next turn following the command. get creative!).

at 2nd level you have hold person which you can flavor as halting their movements via mind control (and is very effective in battle), and you also have suggestion which lasts up to 8 hours, you suggest a course of action and the target has to follow it, as long as it's not harmful to the target.",['spells'],1lz7ato,"I'm playing a ""valley girl"" wizard - any tips on spells to use?"

it sounds like you want to manipulate and bewitch others for your evil plans, so spells like charm person, detect thoughts, crown of madness, tasha's mindwhip, enhance ability (use on yourself and allies), enemies abound, fear, and hypnotic pattern would work. spells like shatter or earthen grasp could be reflavored to your aesthetic (maybe a valley girl shriek, etc.).  things like counterspell or dispel magic could be the wizard cooly ""shutting things down"".

443,n3l56gm,BitOBear,"in the mercer version of the universe, something you would raise from the dead has to want to come back. 

and this is not necessarily just a bloody minded not wanting to come back, play the hint that there is something that your character is going forward into with death. particularly if your character is a character of faith. 

set up with the dm that if anybody does try to wish you back or whatever they would get a glimpse into something horrible or wonderful or truly alien that slams shut the power of that wish. 

or make the point and purpose of the characters death to be significantly irreversible. 

i played a character (in a gurps game) who was either the only believer in a pantheon that everyone had forgotten before recorded history or a complete madman. 

his family had been found dead and he had been found wandering some months later with a strange holy symbol. a tree that had three roots to the curved down and out slightly like slightly bent asses or possibly like a sword breaker and the central root was absolutely a dagger. and the palm oil was the top of the tree. and it was normally held point down as a dagger. it did not function as a sword breaker though it could have, that part was just color text. it was also his offhand weapon because it turns out he was an ambidextrous dual attack combat madman cleric thing. he was a holy man but he didn't have magic spells. he just had a lot of personality when it came to being a holy man. he was also quite large. 

i mentioned all that because during the great showdown at the end of the campaign he basically did his spirit to grab hold of the big bad. the magical essence that was organizing all the bad things. and after spiritually grabbing hold of him his spirit dragged this evil off into the great beyond where none could follow. 

because well he might have been mad and his pantheon might have been imaginary, he was indeed holy. 

in such a setting to draw his spirit back would almost certainly mean to return the spirit he had seized on to and drug away as well. so to bring back the man they would have had to bring back the evil he had carted off into the beyond. 

ain't nobody got time for refighting that entire war. 

so that's how you create, if you must, a character death that needs must never be reversed as part of the structure of a character's death. 

following a loved one and true soulmate into the beyond is another way. 

with the story told correctly the other player characters can be prevented from unpleasantly reviving something you're done with.

445,n3m6rcf,FairlightEx,"since you mentioned wish, i'm gonna assume that your party has that spell available. 

here's a few ideas to deal with:

1. memory erasure or time erasure - have your dm invoke either a god or all-powerful creature of some sort that can devour or rewrite time and/or memories. make your heroic sacrifice to slay said creature, knowing that your own soul, history, or memory will be erased with it, and your party cannot remember you. they cannot wish you back if they don't know who you are, and the dm can shut down any of their attempts to do so pretty easily. if you want to leave a trace or an emotional send off, leave an important item behind. maybe along the lines of ""this sword has a heroic aura around it so strong that the party can feel it, gaining confidence"" or however you want to spin it.

2. be claimed by a god or enter the service of one - you could accept an offer to ascend to a higher plane, becoming the enforcer or servant of a god. you can't be resurrected cuz you aren't actually dead, and any attempts to teleport you back would be foiled by the deity you now serve. this option works nicely cuz you can have your dm assign you any task you want - working as a god's detective, enforcer, hunter, or whatever else.

3. could do the above but with a darker twist, offering up your eternal soul to save the party and/or the world. logic remains mostly the same. players might try to argue they can wish you back if you go this route though.

4. you could go for the classic ""take me instead"" in order to revive someone else, and give up your soul or whatever. exactly how this makes any sense would depend on your storyline so far.

5. some unfathomably powerful evil needs to be sealed away - you volunteer for eternal guard duty against some ancient cosmic evil, and your dm warns that anyone using spells to pull you away from this duty would basically doom the entire universe or whatever.

that's just a few ideas for ways to exit the story in a way that prevents you from returning.

it's hard to say which one i'd go for personally cuz it would depend which character i'm playing and what their story is so far.

if you wanna do the memory loss or history erasure type stuff, look into the false hydra or aboleth. aboleth's normally just mess with one person's memories, but you can ask for a homebrew variant like an aboleth lord or something that can erase your memory from everyone or something like that. false hydra is a homebrew monster that mass erases memories.",['spells'],1m1vix3,I need suggestions on how to PERMANENTLY kill my character.

451,n3o1qo4,NumerousSun4282,"so the struggle here is not the death, it's the idea that wish can bring you back. here's the catch:

either they are using wish to cast a lower level spell like revivify or they are casting wish using the ""great latitude"" portion of the spell description.

to get around the lower level portion, you need to be inaccessible twice over. wish can ignore a restriction on a spell, but i (as a dm) do not interpret that as ignoraning multiple requirements.

if you are beheaded, wish could recreate your head, then a revivify (or another wish) could bring you back. if you are disintegrated, wish could reconstruct you from the dust, then revivify (or another wish) can bring you back.

if you are beheaded *and* your head is disintegrated, that's two wish spells to fix that. lenient rulings could allow one casting, that's arguably raw, but i'd suggest that this is two wishes.

if you are beheaded, disintegrated, sent to another dimension, have your soul trapped in an object and so on, it could become more and more costly to simply wish you back.

using one wish to do all of those things is not recreating a lower level spell, so it would be subject to the dm per the ""great latitude"" section of the spell description. **that also introduces a 33% chance they can never cast wish again!**

from there, you can prepare some results with your dm that meet your preference. for example:

- your character does come back, but as a baby. wishing to restore your age just grows you up but without memory. effectively, your character reappears in appearance but not in personality/memory/skills and is basically just an npc who's very confused

- your character comes back as a magic item. a trinket or something with your character's soul inside. your character can talk with someone holding the item, but can't perceive anything around it, effectively making it a pretty useless item. because of this incredibly limited life, your character requests the release of death so as not to go insane for eternity. cast it into the fires of mt dangerous as a side quest that should be super easy and not an epic spanning like 20 hours of cinema

- your dm tells the character(s) that cast wish that it does not affect a god. leave it at that with no further discussion and let them ponder how your character was a god the whole time

- wish is counter spelled by a powerful entity. i'd suggest someone really evil like orcus maybe. he can definitely counter spell more than players can wish so he can effectively just forever prevent your return until they defeat him. (the dm will need to prepare for an encounter in which multiple people try to use up orcus' reaction - have some counterspell minions available!)

- your character returns having seen the divinity of life after death and wishes to introduce that glory to all. ""no suffering or pain or anguish or loss in the after life. i must show it to you!"" the character becomes a bbeg in a spinoff campaign

- you reappear, say you were really busy and nows not a good time and commit suicide. rinse and repeat. characters that disrespect this request to not be resurrected would automatically change their alignment to chaotic evil, so unless they were already that, they'd become npcs under the dms control",['spells'],1m1vix3,I need suggestions on how to PERMANENTLY kill my character.

revivify doesn't _need_ to say the soul must be willing, nor do the other resurrection spells. it is a general rule that the soul must be willing, see chapter 1 of the dmg. a spell would need to **explicitly** say that it works on unwilling souls in order to be able to do so, not simply omit reiterating the general rule.",['spells'],1m1vix3,I need suggestions on how to PERMANENTLY kill my character.

which is perfectly a-okay. that’s what d&d does great, provide tons of options for players to theorycraft and min-max.

trouble is, this boardgame approach puts a ton of bookkeeping and encounter design on the shoulders of a dm. what you see as a nifty way to go ‘pew pew’, your dm will have to counter to both let you enjoy, but also give you challenging/interesting encounters - while also trying to ensure that said counter doesn’t auto kill the rest of the party. the easiest way is just a blanket nerf that you can see as a compliment that you actually broke the system, and now you’re offered a new challenge.

\-

the better way is to talk with your dm about limits. are they more up for a simpler d&d with basic archetype classes, ditching the funky ‘smurf’ races for the classic tolkien races etc. oftentimes restraint in choice and boundaries leads to better games and better stories than throwing everything and the kitchen sink into a melting pot and hoping it makes sense. it also makes for a lot more interesting characters if every outcast emo kid isn’t descending from some tragic line of daemons, but just shunned because they’re anti-social, and they actually have agency in their lives.

a more radical approach could be to try to change systems - there are few rpgs that are as rules bloated as d&d, while most of them encourage a different style of play than what you get from the class/level modular approach to character building. e.g. a game like blades in the dark doesn’t even let the dm roll dice, in return it doesn’t develop that dm vs players narrative. you wouldn’t think it at first, but the system have a huge impact on playstyle, for this reason i like to play dedicated skirmish miniature games to satisfy the tactical thinking in me, while i want the social interactions and the collaborative narrative experience from rpgs.

fighter is strong, especially with the buffs, but it is by no means op. echo knight is also really strong, but it absolutely does not rival a spell caster. limiting the echoes is really bad for the character's usefulness (everything from the subclass is tied to them!) and it's really unfair.

and no, inquisitive doesn't need debuffs at all. on the contrary, depending on the campaign style, it sucks ass, and even on a campaign tailored for the subclass, a wizard or a cleric with the right spells (which aren't hard to have) will probably do everything it does and so much more.

duration: concentration, up to 1 hour

the creature you touch feels reality subtly shifted to its favor while this spell is in effect. the target isn't inconvenienced by mundane delays of any sort. traffic lights are always green, there's always a waiting elevator, and a taxi is always around the corner. the target can run at full speed through dense crowds, and attacks of opportunity provoked by the target's movement are made with disadvantage.

synchronicity grants advantage to dexterity (stealth) checks, since the target always finds a handy piece of cover available. additionally, the target has advantage on all ability checks made to drive a vehicle.

- players tracking their resources is fundamental to d&d 5e and your players should absolutely be doing this.
- you are valid in feeling frustrated and annoyed with your players for not listening to you when telling them to track their resources.
- denying them use of their features without warning them in advance they'll face this penalty will come off as harsh.

i'm assuming you're playing with friends and/or want to keep playing this game outside of this issue. i'd advise that you have a really clear conversation with them and explain that the game of d&d 5e you're currently playing doesn't work if they don't track their resources accurately.

hopefully if they're decent people then when you explain that them not putting in the effort to track their resources feels disrespectful when you're putting in a bunch of effort to dm for you.

if they're new players simply getting them to use d&d beyond or any other digital character sheet could be the helpful tool that makes it easier for them to track things.

if they're not fussed about all the mechanics of d&d, then maybe you guys should consider playing a more narrative-focused rules-light game system that has less for them to track and less work for you.

there is a middle ground where you keep playing d&d and accept that if you want to play with these people then you have to accept they don't track their resources, so you just use slightly more powerful monsters - either use relevant monsters with higher challenge rating, or give the monsters you are using small increases to their health/armour class/bonuses to hit/damage done/dc of their abilities etc. and maybe even give them bigger abilities. that way you can enjoy things by getting to use bigger cooler monsters and your players and you guys can all keep playing together.",['class'],1lrbt9z,Am i overreacting?

rolled a 20.

he had a brief vision of a rock in space and a single word came to his mind: ""asteroid"".

i have since established this rule:

i think that most deities wouldn't bother talking  to some random person, even if they're a cleric.  they might do something like ""stop being a murder hobo"", or donk a reward on someone for following the deity's dogma/stuff.  



for the campaign i'm building, most deities of any real power wouldn't interfere in people's day to day lives like that, they might send good vibes or dreams or something, but not have conversations regularly.  i do have one goddess that might just because she's a little bit chaos gremlin, but she's supposed to be a point of contact and ally for the players/player characters, so it's in line with what she'd do.  she definitely would not talk with every random npc that prays to her, they don't even get her name right, but she would (shortly) chat with important people, but it's up to her who gets to be important.  


now, if the cleric is the only cleric, paladin, powerful person, player character, etc., that worships them, then probably yes.  a bit like jester/the traveler in campaign 2 of critical role.  they'd want to expand their worshippers so actually talking with everyone would be to their benefit.

i suppose maybe the deity might chat as a way to guide the cleric down the path they want, since the player seems to want it, but i'd probably stick it to major plot points and level ups.  then you (and the deity) won't get roped into everyday strife/nonsense/useless chats.  they're a god/goddess, not their bff that you can chat to/complain about your day to.",['spells'],1lsweah,Do your clerics talk to their gods?
547,n1n7jkt,Rabbitfaster13,"you can pray night and day and perhaps your deity will show you they are listening in some way. they give you all of your abilities all the time. commune and similar spells are there for a reason. if your god is going to answer whenever you ask anything then your cleric isn’t a cleric, they’re a divine warlock that can entreats their patron nearly at will. 

perhaps before i get deeper into this you should establish if you have the divine gate in your world and what that means to you and your players because that would fix everything. 

there is so much more in just the class descriptions that show why gods don’t communicate fully.  

clerics choose a god and have to embody their beliefs and spread their faith to continue growing that gods power and favor, not just use their power to do whatever they want in any way they want. the cleric is in service to the god, not the other way around. it’s a long game a god plays to have a mortal spread their influence with religion and actions. 

warlock patrons always have a goal/plans in mind when they offer a pact unless it’s a very rare situation etc.  they are usually (usually) not behind the divine gate and not greater gods so they can freely influence and interact with the world the character is a part of. often this is far more immediately symbiotic than a cleric. a patron will also often times be more aggressive about wanting/needing their pact holder to recruit more warlocks or followers to them. it’s specifically how they grow in power most of the time unless they are already a god. 


paladins rarely, if ever (in my experience) have a direct chat with the god they have pledged an oath to. most paladins function off their oath and the god or thing they pledged to plays second fiddle to role playing the subclass. paladins in my mind, again to me, are more about ideals than a connection to a gods whims.  

this got away from me. my autism fired up and now my adhd has derailed everything. 

i think what i’m trying to say is your player may not be seeing their relationship with their god, as a cleric, in the right way at all.  gods in fantasy can often be fickle even when they grant blessings left and right. a blessing can still be a curse.   so talk to them about what they think their class is actually about. remind them that their god is basically a part of the dm’s knowledge and therefore cannot have all the answers or it would just be cheating.

i don’t think gods should or shouldn’t talk a certain level, but use each individual gods level of interaction as story building in your setting. if the god of murder can declare things for all his loyal subjects to listen and abide by, why can’t the god of nature commune with the druids out in the world. there’s no right or wrong answer here :)",['spells'],1lsweah,Do your clerics talk to their gods?
551,n1njo1r,Lumis_umbra,"well, yeah. the phb says that clerics are specifically chosen by their deity as their direct representative and intermediary in the mortal realm. *it doesn't even have to be a volunteer.*
so they get spoken in some way to at *least* once. but the gods don't just answer the prayer phone like a customer service rep. ""hello, you've reached the goddess morrigan, how may i help you, my cleric?"", *isn't going to happen.* there's rules that prevent god/desses from directly interfering in mortal affairs. (in canon d&d, at least. ao, the supreme deity made such rules.) and a god/dess is always busy with something or other.
they send orders once in a while, prophetic dreams and visions, et cetera. they swap out the cleric's divine spells when the cleric prays for that. 


i see it as:

the god/dess chooses someone who represents their beliefs and tenets the best. they then speak to that person and tell them ""congrats! you're my new cleric."". ***the mortal does not get a choice in this.*** and sometimes, the best candidate that a god/dess can find is actually an ***unwilling*** one. remember- they're looking for someone who embodies their views and tenets- not someone who necessarily likes or has ever prayed to them. that doesn't matter in the slightest. the best cleric of lathander may have been a country bumpkin farmer who thanked the sun daily for the growth of his/her crops, and lived a good life, having never heard of lathander at all.

the god/dess then gives *their* **divine mandate.** the new cleric gets told to go deal with the thing the diety wants done, and the god/dess then gives the cleric a small sliver of divine power. the cleric now has magic, and effectively- it's on loan for so long as they keep to their patron diety's wishes. if they do well, they get more power over time (leveling up). break their tenets, violate their temples, be a bad representation of them, et cetera, and the cleric loses that power. if they do it on purpose? that god/dess will make an example out of them.

occasionally, the cleric will get messages, orders, visions, et cetera. but the *god/dess* is *not* going to be on call to fix the cleric's problems. that would be directly interfering- something that they typically can not do.

my *personal* cleric characters are absolute zealots, though- hard not to be one when the gods can *prove* that they exist. so *my* clerics ask their deity for signs of what they should do. never for help. it's also great for the dm, because all they have to do to get the party on track is say ""you get a vision from your deity. it shows that you should go to such-and-such place, and find such-and-such. it's hazy, but here's a rough description of this *highly important* thing you must do."". it makes the dm's life so much easier when the cleric is divinely ordered to get stuff done. what's the party going to do without the cleric- go broke buying potions?",['spells'],1lsweah,Do your clerics talk to their gods?

when i play clerics (or warlocks, for that matter), i prefer their gods to be ineffable beings who respond in signs and patterns that my character notices from time to time. this allows the gm to give me clues and guidance (outside of spells, of course) in a way that isn’t railroaded, and also skips the need for dialogue and all that. in other words: gods are too big for mortal minds, make them speak with signs. feels better.

the way i handle it , the cleric can ask for advice or whatever , but the god will not always answer depending on:

\*the question itself  / importance and urgency , there is such a thing as a stupid question

\*the domain of the god / war gods will most likely choose more proactive or violent answers

\*the faith and devotion of the cleric / life cleric that is a murderhobo will not have a good rep with his god

the god will not outright answer and just give slight nods or vague hints at best , the cleric can ask for guidance as much as he wants but that doesnt mean the god will answer , it depends on the situation and  actions of the cleric , mechanically if i deem it right  , the pc must roll a d20 \[evens it answer\] - \[odds not answer\] , the higher the cleric lvl the less vague the answer , spells still work as normal and ofcourse , if the guidance is important storywise it could be a vision or literal words",['spells'],1lsweah,Do your clerics talk to their gods?

the gods themselves are distant, forces of nature personified. they're in a completely different level of reality and may not even need worshipers to have the level of power they currently have.

the gods don't need direct attention the way other entities do, so they don't directly communicate. maybe even largely consciously unaware of the fact that they are providing spells and benefits to most true believers. they rarely pay attention to mortals, and when they do, it's almost never a good thing for the mortals in question even if it is a good thing for the survival of the world.",['spells'],1lsweah,Do your clerics talk to their gods?

559,n1ohi1z,FlyingToasters101,"it entirely depends on the game, the setting, the character, and the god in question. if you're in a setting like the forgotten realms where the gods are pretty active and have all been just wandering around in the world not /too/ long ago, it's not that far of a stretch. i mean hell look at baldur's gate 3, you can talk to 5 gods i think?   
  
if you're in a lower fantasy setting or just one where the gods can't/won't interfere as much then you probably wouldn't have the opportunity to speak to them directly. my dms homebrew setting has magicy reasons the gods shouldn't manifest on the prime directly and they have difficulty sending divine agents to the world so the best priests get without magic or class features is visions or maybe hearing their voice in one of their holy places once or twice.   
  
personally i've always been a fan of the more distant approach, because it adds so much weight when you do get to speak to them a little more face to face. i got to meet my dm's goddess of death once and he ran it like speak with dead with stakes lol - i could ask her up to 5 questions but each time she answered i had to roll a death saving throw because being in the presence of death herself was too powerful for my tiny mortal self. sweating over wording my questions and surviving that encounter felt so cool. 🔥",['class'],1lsweah,Do your clerics talk to their gods?
560,n1otihv,ThatMerri,"it depends on the character and the god in question.  in settings like the forgotten realms, there are plenty of gods who will grant power to mortals they choose for some divine purpose but rarely - or even never - directly communicate with them at all.  some of the more stand-offish gods might send a middle manager type messenger to do all the talking for them.  other gods, especially evil ones, might see it as beneath them to talk to mortals at all and refuse to do so.

on the far other end of the spectrum, there are gods who will happily muck about with the mortals.  bahamut is pretty infamous for his ""old man with seven canaries"" disguise to walk among mankind when he feels like it, so it's much more plausible for him to directly speak with one of his clerics.  for halflings, their gods - yondalla and the associated pantheon of halfling deities - are extremely close and casual with halflings, so it's not even a little odd for them physically manifest and hang out among their kind, regardless of whether there are any clerics present or not.  on a similar vein, lesser or diminished gods in need of managing their smaller power base of faithful followers might directly speak with mortals simply out of necessity.

so, with your situation in mind, you have to balance what kind of personality the god in question has versus how often your player intends to chat it up.  if they're a major deity with a lot to handle, or with a distant personality, they probably won't answer.  you can always split the difference with the aforementioned messenger; the deity could basically assign one of their messengers to be the player's personal point of contact and speak on their behalf, so the player can chat with them instead.  depending on how you play it, said player might not even realize they're talking to middle management for some time.

it also depends on what kind of things your player is hoping to speak about.  if your player wants to get to know their god personally, or is curious about the setting/lore, that's one thing.  but if they intend to ring their god up for advice every time they don't know what to do, or want help in solving problems, then that's pushing it since it encroaches on mechanical effects.  a cleric doesn't get free, at-will ""augury"" spells just because they ask nicely.",['spells'],1lsweah,Do your clerics talk to their gods?
561,n1p1rep,CupidArrowArt,"in the campaign my friends and i just finished, my cleric would occasionally have direct conversations with his goddess. more often than not, i would use spells like divination and, later, commune, but there were times that i was allowed a direct conversation with said god. it was likely because our dm is very generous and tends to operate under the rule of cool, but my in world justification for it was that my cleric was sort of a chosen one.

when i dm and gods are involved, i will also allow characters to communicate with them directly, often times through dreams; i am also a very generous dm who operates under rule of cool as well. justification for these interactions varied, and it wasn’t always a god and a cleric involved.

in both cases, neither of these scenarios were situations where the character could ask directly for a favor or provide exact answers to questions; they were more conversations on things that were happening in game the characters were already aware of and, sometimes, there would be information provided. i do have one example of a character requesting something from his god, and the god accepting it, but the character was literally disengaged from reality and the flow of time, so it felt like an instance where the gods might investigate.

ultimately, i believe it’s up to the dms discretion. i don’t think there’s anything wrong with characters having direct but brief conversations with gods, but it shouldn’t be abused to get favors or direct answers to questions.",['spells'],1lsweah,Do your clerics talk to their gods?

and it's that last situation where i will occasionally break my veil of mystery and permit direct conversation. but it's a rarely used tool in my toolbox, and i only pull it out at the appropriate time. usually it's not even direct conversation, but conversation through some divine intermediary like a demon or an angel.",['class'],1lsweah,Do your clerics talk to their gods?

don’t make the gods, either existing from whatever world you’re playing in or homebrewed, so common and accessible. faith without direct answer or interaction is the basis of all religions. being a cleric gifted with the miracle of healing is more than enough of an answer without the use of spells or moments of heroic sacrifice guided by faith. and make those moments of interaction feel like a blending of, “is this even real?” and, “this is larger and more vast of a presence than the very continents we walk upon.”

levels 8 to 15 or so: the cleric will be contacted by a demigod avatar of their god.  this can be whatever you want, classically it would be a long-dead mortal hero the god had elevated after they died.  the cleric will still pray to their god for daily spells, but the avatar will become a focus of communication for the cleric and their advancement, at least as far as their worship and place in the church is concerned.

levels 16 to 19: the cleric is in direct communication with their god.

no, the only class that does is the warlock. the warlock pretty much had to make a deal with a being of power that is probably a little lower on the divine rank than a god. for a warlock, talking to your patron is like being a new hire at a small business. the founder has enough time and energy to direct you personally. they might have even done your interview themselves. they know your face and your voice. they will know if you violate your employment contract, as they are watching you.

but what op maybe talking about is the thing where the character jester on critical role had an ongoing interpersonal relationship with a faith she had deified aggressively enough and with enough chatter that the deification took hold. 

and that is not a normal cleric deity relationship. that's basically the special relationship between a newfound god and their first customer. 

so we have two different views on the mad mercer effect on the definition of cleric from the same set of interactions. 

part of the reason that critical role is fun but also harmful to gaming is that they are a bunch of voice actors who are well trained dramatists and they expect their games in real life to play exactly like they play on that show instead of expecting to have to play them the way they would play them with the skills and interests of the people actually sitting at the same table as them at the time. 

why isn't every shopping trip to buy a single magical item a 1 hour character experience in my table? because that interaction from critical role is extending television and we're not on television in casa de bido bear so we're not being paid to basically ignore the game to please an audience.

anyway, if players attack a high level creature they can’t beat, then they also reap what they sow. if it was in character and in the right context, i would absolutely initiate a tpk-level fight. run or die.

but like you said the big bad had reason not to retaliate. at best they’re now on his radar, and he will be spying/scrying on their progress every now and then, and if he sees they are making progress towards defeating him, he will intervene with minions or maybe by himself. the party will need to seek out scrying protection, at which point the big bad will be more prepared for anything. kitting out his home base, using spells as precautions etc. evil doesn’t sleep.

at worst, he seeks out the party afterwards and makes an example by killing the bard 🤷‍♂️",['spells'],1m7xu86,[OC] DM Advice] How do you handle player defiance against overwhelmingly powerful NPCs? (Lvl 4 Bard vs CR 16 Dragon)

582,n4yhwti,askaofficial,"i think you handled this splendidly given the circumstances. if they're in a situation where retaliation is more feasible in a future encounter, i think it can be fun as the player to feel a real consequence, like destroying or taking something 'important' ish from the character can help set them up as a villain. almost like the bbeg taunting the party. as long as you don't handicap the player in a way that makes it less fun for them to play. if they try to attack or anything really aggresive you can knock the pc out or make the villain ""tire of the company"" ""throw them out"" or ""leave abruptly."" and make sure to let them try to deal damage if so. we managed a nat20 attack on our bbeg when we were severly undeleveled for the encounter and that left a ""crack"" in his magic. essentially the bbeg it toying with the players at that point. you can make sure you set the player character up for replacing what they lost with something or giving them something different over time to reflect a change. for me, my star druid got her star map permanently destroyed by the bbeg for spitting on him, which spurred her to find out how to use magic without it and furthered her resentment for him.

turned out, that led to my character discovering they can cast spells without that focus, which had implications on the campaign. and set them to seek out other focuses to discover more about it.

608,mzskw9k,Atharen_McDohl,"okay so the thing with healing in d&d is that it's *wildly* inefficient to do it during combat. if you try to keep all your party members topped up on hp all the time, the only thing you're going to accomplish is wasting all your spell slots. by your next turn, all the hp you recovered is just gonna be gone again. and likely even more than that. so what's a poor healer to do?

reframe your expectations. the goal of a healer isn't to keep everyone healed, it's to keep everyone alive. those are two very different things. the best way to keep your party alive is to stop the things that are trying to kill you.  that means that even for a healer, you should be focused on doing damage rather than healing. if all your enemies are dead, your party will stop losing health, after all. then when combat is over, you say ""alright everyone, sit down and take a break because even if i had the twenty spell slots i'd need to heal you all, i wouldn't spend them. we're taking a short rest, use your hit dice.""

but wait, then what's the difference between a healer and any other sort of build? well, not that much to be honest, but there is a difference. as mentioned above, a healer is there to keep everyone alive. everyone contributes to that goal by killing enemies, but healers do have the capacity to provide healing as needed. you just want to do it more efficiently than burning an entire action *and* spell slot just to heal a meaningless amount of damage which is gonna be lost immediately anyway.

there are a few ways to do that, and the first is to save your healing until it's actually needed. ask yourself a question: are any of your allies likely to reach 0 hp before your next turn? if no, don't heal them. like actually don't. let them keep going, and you just keep frying your enemies. by focusing enemies down one at a time, you might even be able to prevent whatever damage they might have taken if you wasted your turn on healing them. even if an ally *is* likely to go down, that doesn't necessarily mean you need to heal them right away to prevent that. maybe they'll beat the odds and stay up for another turn, and even if they do go down, you still have time to get them back up.

which brings us to the next strategy: don't spend your action to heal. did you notice that there are two basic healing spells? cure wounds and healing word. at first glance, healing word just seems like a worse version of cure wounds. they're the same level, but healing word doesn't heal as much. so you might be surprised to learn that the d&d community generally treats healing word as being *vastly* superior to cure wounds. why? because healing word only takes a bonus action, and you can use it from a distance. this means that you can still use your action to do damage, and you don't have to put yourself in danger by moving right next to your ally. but what about the low healing? well first, it's not that much lower. second, it's because the goal isn't to heal everyone, it's to keep everyone alive. how much healing is needed to pick up an unconscious ally? 1 hp. that's it. one hit point is the difference between a dying character and one who is back up and actively contributing to the fight again.

in short, use healing word instead of cure wounds, save your healing for when it's actually needed, and rely on short rests for the majority of your healing. also, tell your allies to stop getting surrounded.",['spells'],1lkkzeo,Being healer is tough

614,mzu7rn8,StarTrotter,"to be fair i think the ultimate question is who's action economy is better.

let's say you are playing a life cleric and turn one you cast spirit guardians. you have your best damage dealing spell set up. now you could on your subsequent turns cast leveled spells, a cantrip, or take the dodge/dash/disengage action. all of these can be situationally valuable.

that said healing has its value outside of healing a downed ally. if it keeps them from going down it can avoid them dying, it can keep that caster or yourself up so they don't lose concentration on their spell, rage, etc, it can decrease the odds of an ally losing their turn, and it can give them a chance to deal damage. damage is admittedly a tad bit overrated but if you have the nasty boss sometimes a lot of damage is the best answer and in those scenarios the action surging fighter gwm is going to deal more damage than you. if you are the only healer/reviver you going down can also kick up the stakes significantly.

the flaw with healing is that 

1. since the only hp that matters is the very last hp that heal is only worth something if it lets an ally not go down when they should have gone down (if you heal your barbarian but they manage to not get hit from then on that's not completely wasted as it might save hit dice but it probably would have been better to cast something else.

a common mistake dms make is not telling their players what their characters know. especially for the you didn't know he's immune to that big spell hahahahha moment, which isn't fun for the players. the boss can still be immune but have the player before casting the spell roll arcana to see if they know it will fail. now they get to be rewarded for a good die roll and feel smart for thinking up a new plan. 

better yet, just tell your players the resources the boss has. that way they get to feel clever about working around them. this boss has three tattoos on his arm, after the first legendary resistance is used one of them fades! it's on the players to work as a team to burn through them to drop the big spells. 

also have enough henchmen, legendary actions, or lair actions to make the action economy equal to the players. now the fight is not one dude getting attacked six times before his turn. 

lastly add a second health bar that cannot be bursted through if you want a really epic fight. when the bbeg's health drops below the first health bar. he starts glowing red or w/e and you tell the party he's immune to damage untill the next round when he gets some new ability and they can start round 2!",['spells'],1m2xt81,How to deal with powerfull Spellcaster PCs as a DM without hard-countering them to much?

additionally the intent of the game is that there will be more challenges/encounters between long rests than spell casters have spell slots for. with a 6-8 encounter *adventuring day* choosing when to cast spells is an important part of roleplaying a caster pc. with less than 4 encounters between long rests ""mechanically"" picking the most powerful/destructive spell to hand is virtually always the best tactic.

a ""boss battle"" in some kind of dungeon, where the party first needs to get through 4-5 groups of hostile npcs and/or traps might work raw. ditto for having such encounteres happen very infrequently, at least one in every fifty fights. if you put a single enemy in front of a fully rested party the only way it can possibly be any kind of challenge is janky homebrew. lots of extra work for you and frustrating for your players...

on your side i wouldn't have a single big boss alone. it's cool to have them but also have the lieutenant, and the minions. that gives him more targets for those spells. that's also just generally better for the balance of your fights in general. the game is not really designed well to go 1vparty without the party having a huge advantage. 

the other way to challenge him is to have multiple fights per day. at level 10 he's got 8 spell slots of 3rd level or higher, more if he uses sorcerery points for it. have enough fights that he can't use one of those on every turn. so they're still great and impactful spells, but some turns he's throwing out a cantrip or a scorching ray.",['spells'],1m2xt81,How to deal with powerfull Spellcaster PCs as a DM without hard-countering them to much?

637,n3vrrkt,IvoryGrill,"dnd full caster main here:
played for 10+ years and full casters and mages are my bread and butter.

use what you have available. if the players can use it, so can you.

mageslayer is a feat you can give your enemies that they need to deal with. mages have a hard time dealing with multiple enemies at a time. (even better if you get them fire resistance, cause ya know, hehe fireball.)

mages with counter spell; all you need is 3 mages with counter spell to win the counter spell-off.

certain enemies are harder for mages because of higher wis/dex/int/cha that you can throw at them to make it harder for them to get full damage of a saving throw based spell.

sorcerers can only change spells via level up, and if they pack their spells full of cold or fire based spell, etc., then you can play with resistance or immunities so that it’ll teach them to prepare for things like this, in spite of throw big damage out. teaches without punishing.

druids are harder; most of the time they are an issue in terms of wild shape, but if the spells are causing issue, and since they can change spells every long rest, their spell list is relatively easy to prepare for.

if these casters rely on cc spells, spells like banishment, etc., then you could have your party gain a slight bit of notoriety in campaign/world. so that people (specifically their potential enemies) would learn how they fight. and prepare for such.

and then for level 10 casters; it’s gonna get harder because you start getting up there so they will make them save much more often and likely the enemy will fail, so having them deal with a boss could be hard, but you can mitigate that by giving the big boss minions. with mage slayer? with magic resistance? up to you!

also; combat can be more than just big boss; work with terrain, have a moving arena or lair that rotates 90 degrees every round or two.

have the arena cut the party in half so half of them have to deal with the boss and the other half need to deal with a terrain issue.

you don’t need to have your bosses be feast or famine. so have fun!

i remember a lightning rod-type genasi bbeg that gave himself and everyone around him lightning immunity. i hinted at a powerful  crystal locked away in the depths of what was essentially a governmental body that regulates magic. the crystal could give everyone that touches it and succeeds a con save a 5hr buff to pierce any spell immunities, but removing it from its location would destroy the crystal. 

they burned resources to get to the crystal and then immediately fought the guy without being able to long rest beforehand, else they lose the buff. they felt rewarded for being smart, pulling off the heist, and got to enjoy a very nice combat that they couldnt just nova through. felt very nice.

645,n3ssft7,MultivariableX,"the implication is that they go find a safe place, take a long rest, and return to the dungeon fully replenished.

it's a very video-game style of play that breaks quickly if the mission has a ticking clock, or if the party is prevented from escaping danger.

5e is designed around an adventuring day with 6-8 encounters, of which several will be combat.  it also assumes that the party won't simply be able to rest whenever they want to, and will therefore have to manage their resources with this in mind.

when rests take longer and are farther between, class resources with rest-based limits become more precious.  if there's no consequence to waiting, players will understandably want to wait so that their characters can be at their most capable in the next encounter.  but if there is a consequence, the players will then have to weigh the potential benefits of a rest against the potential consequences.

it's also important for the dm to keep in mind what the players understand to be happening.  if the players are treating a rest as if it pauses time around them, they might be upset to learn that this wasn't the case, and that the enemy has been making progress in their plans unopposed.  the expectation that the world will both react to the party and continue to act with or without the party should be established early in the campaign, preferably at session zero so that the players can bring characters they want to play with those expectations.",['class'],1m2xt81,How to deal with powerfull Spellcaster PCs as a DM without hard-countering them to much?

> going into a dungeon and doing 1 room/day is like going to work, answering a single email, and going home-- it's a waste of everyone's time.

i agree.  within the narrative of the game world, it would seem very unsatisfying for the player of an adventurer.  i get a particular thrill from prolonged action scenes in movies, where the characters must survive a series of attacks and hazards with rapidly-dwindling resources, being forced to adapt their tactics and use their wits as the situation changes around them, while also not having a chance to rest.

but on the other hand, there are athletes who train for years to do one thing that only takes a handful of minutes to accomplish.  there are board members of corporations whose only job is to show up to a meeting a couple of times a year, and maybe schmooze some investors over drinks or a round of golf.  there are soldiers and firefighters who could be called upon to risk their lives at any moment, but most of their time is spent preparing and performing other duties.

the satisfaction people get from their jobs does not directly correlate with the number of hours spent at work, or the amount of danger they put themselves in.  this is a myth, perpetuated to dehumanize real people by reducing their worth to where they fall on a productivity metric, all for the sake of making a number on stock ticker go up.

> what is the party doing for the rest of the day? what sort of position does your party occupy that they can afford to take it that slowly?

i would imagine that they would spend the rest of their time training, preparing, recovering, socializing, playing sports or games, reading, competing, engaging with hobbies, eating, and helping in their own communities.  and there are indeed video games that use this as a mechanic, with different npcs having different schedules.  stardew valley lets you do whatever you want during the day, but you still have to sleep at night and there's always something happening that you'll miss out on.

a low-level pc adventurer is already superhuman compared to a commoner npc.  it's not unusual for a player to create a character who comes from a privileged upbringing, isolation, or trauma that can help narratively explain why that character is capable of explosive feats of heroism, but also needs to withdraw quickly.

as for what position that character holds in their fictional society, that's something for the dm and player to navigate.  in superhero comics, those characters are often divisive figures in their settings, being praised for their powers and good deeds, while also being jeered for any perceived failings, or suspected of having ulterior motives.

> 5-minute adventuring days simply don't make sense-- why would unmotivated people be willing to risk their lives adventuring in the first place? 

i think this question is based on a false assumption.

ttrpgs are an abstraction, not a simulation.  a party having a single combat encounter and then returning to base to rest may give the appearance of a lack of motivation, but that ignores all of the things that go along with that, which would be time-consuming to describe and have little to no mechanical effect.

we don't need to know what the characters had for breakfast, what stretches they did, the details of putting on their armor, the errands and obligations they dealt with before leaving town, the route they took, the travel conditions, trivial encounters with other travelers, wild animals, unthreatening monsters, and threats they either avoided or intimidated.  we don't need to know how they found the dungeon entrance, whether it was guarded, how they got inside, what traps or surveillance they dealt with, the sights, smells, and sounds of the place.

any or all of that could make for interesting roleplay, immersive storytelling, or encounters (social, exploration, or combat) in their own right, and the dm can certainly decide when and how to employ those things.  but the dm can also say something like, ""spent from that battle, you leave to rest in town and return to the dungeon the next day.  we'll pick up in the last room you explored.""

> is there never any time pressure in your campaigns? no pressing threat to deal with, no goal to accomplish, no people to save?

personally, i've tried both.

in one campaign, the party was on a schedule since they were involved in a competition with events at certain times.  i spaced the events to allow for either a long rest, a short rest, or no rest between them, with the players and their characters being aware of this timing.  during and between these events, i also provided options that the players could explore if they chose to, with the understanding that if they were away for too long, they could end up hurting their chances for victory.

my current campaign takes place in a video game setting, with a lot of the monster and npc behavior taking inspiration from that.  there was an inciting event and ""tutorial"" combat in the starting area.  the characters receive a quest and are transported to the location to accomplish (the first stage of) that quest.  at this point, they can talk with who they want, pursue the quest as they see fit, or go do other things like explore the area and find monsters to fight.  the quest remains open until their actions resolve it, and they can pick up and complete other quests along the way.  time passes, but it's up to the players to decide how urgent their situation is from context clues.

in either style, i keep track of the world state invisibly, and adjust as needed.  when i know the party is going somewhere, i can populate that location based on how much time has passed.  for example, a certain traveling npc could be in one town this week, and in a different town the next.  since the players don't know this character's schedule, their first encounter may seem like coincidence, or like it was always intended to happen there.  having that ambiguity is important, so that the players can always feel as if they are in control of what direction to take their adventure.

when the party gets somewhere, they may learn of people who died recently, who they could have saved if they had arrived sooner.  if that deadly threat is still in the area, they could choose to confront it and potentially save more lives, or they could move along to their next destination, perhaps to get ahead of the threat in order to try to save others.

there is no perfect world in which they can save everyone, so it's up to them to pick their battles.  do they move more slowly and cautiously, in the interest of better securing a decisive victory later, knowing that in their absence others will suffer?  do they move quickly and boldly, to achieve the most good in the short term for the people around them, but expending resources that could have done more good elsewhere?  do they recruit and train allies to multiply their own effectiveness?

these are all valid options, and the pcs' individual stories are also taking place within that strategic context.  for example, one pc is looking to get married, and will think about npcs in relation to that goal.  that's already had some consequences in roleplay, and it could have combat consequences as well.  this is a 5e game, and the ceremony spell gives mechanical benefits to humanoids who get married.",['feats'],1m2xt81,How to deal with powerfull Spellcaster PCs as a DM without hard-countering them to much?

for cc, depends on the party. if you have a caster with something like hypnotic pattern or similar, definitely helps as any enemies that fail are usually just out of the fight. plant growth is really good for this, it reduces movement to 1/4. a creature with 30 movement can only move one space forward in plant growth (7.5ft) and it stacks with other spells that cause difficult terrain, and it isn't concentration, so the druid who casts that can cast spike growth next turn and now enemies basically can't get to you without flying/jumping.

if you are another martial, your options for your action might be quite limited (action surge or not for fighters, grapple or not, spell or not for rangers and paladins), or you might have a decent number of options (cunning strike, brutal strike for higher level barbarians).

  
your bonus action is usually straightforward with martials (second wind or not), but it's usually something that is directly dictated by your action decision (which smite to add, smite or not, hunters mark, dual wielding extra attack, gwm/pam extra attack) or you might have more options (cunning action).

even if you are a caster, at level 7 you get 11 spells prepared. unless you are a wizard 2-3 of those are going to be rituals and a further 2-3 might be out of combat utility spells. that leaves you with 5-6 combat spells. it looks complex, but realistically you will develop go-to spells relatively quickly which will slowly leave you with 3-4 options per action, and your bonus action is usually again directly dictated by your action.

  
as a monk, you both have a not-that-limited-action decision (stunning strike or not, grapple or not), you also have a complex bonus action decision that is usually not dictated at all by your action decision. additionally, your extra movement makes something that most other characters don't care much about a resource you can use round to round. even if the extra 10-30 ft movement isn't going to present new opportunities every combat (and honestly given how good step of the wind is now, it will), you will still be looking out for those opportunities.

in 2024 5e, their ability to contribute against enemies in any way other than damage output is significantly nerfed, and their primary incentive to not remain locked in melee got changed into a tool that lets them facetank effortlessly (at low levels, at least). this comes at the same time as other martials gaining new features that gave them more complexity, particularly in areas monks are extremely lacking in in 2024 5e.

so monks are considered ""high complexity"" in 2024 5e so the people who wanted what the 2024 monk became could feel like they were playing a complicated class...when instead it got reduced to something that expects you to automatically run up to enemies and use the exact same action/bonus action/reaction on 99% of your turns, while having nothing to contribute in non-combat situations.",['class'],1lsg745,"Why are Monks considered ""high complexity""?"

i think a big thing is that along with the mad nature of them which you've already responded to they are a class that has big choices to make with their actions, bonus actions, ki usage, and reactions. do you attack or do you take the dodge action (especially because your ba can make the same or more attacks as your attack action)? do you want to burn through your ki with subclass features + stunning strike + the ki bonus actions or do you want to play more conservatively with your ki? do you do the free version of the ba or the ki version of the ba? do you make a reaction attack or a deflect attack? which attack should you deflect attack?

as a quick comparison mages are absolutely complex as every turn they will possibly consider what spell is best for the situation and they might have class or subclass features further complicating that (do i use my once per lr/sr feature here? do i spend a metamagic to ba cast a spell and then dodge action) but their turns tend to be down to 1-2 big choices. monks meanwhile have 2-3 smaller choices but each being incredibly valuable to how the monk functions.",['class'],1lsg745,"Why are Monks considered ""high complexity""?"

673,n23gn9i,Old_Man_D,"actually, you wouldn’t be able to cast even a cantrip with your bonus action in the provided scenario, at least under 2014 rules. 

in 2014, which based on the post flair, i think we’re talking about, if you cast a leveled spell as an action, you simply cannot cast any spell as a bonus action. the only way to work in a bonus action spell and a leveled spell in the same turn would be if the leveled spell was the bonus action spell to begin with. so if instead of cure wounds it was healing word, or maybe they quickened cure wounds using metamagic, then and only then could they cast a cantrip with their action. 

note, this restriction only exists if you want to involve your bonus action, and would also prevent you from casting counterspell to counter the counterspell, if done on your own turn. again, this is only in a scenario where you want to cast a spell with your bonus action. 

if say, spiritual weapon was already cast on a previous turn, there is no restriction to use your bonus action to control it, it merely only restricts on the initial cast. 

if you’re talking 2024 rules, it’s slightly different and it matters which spells used spell slots. in the example, the villain counterspelled the cleric, which means the cleric didn’t use a spell slot for the failed cure wounds. this in turn means they can cast spiritual weapon on that same turn, since that would be the spell presumably using the spell slot and it still abides by the “one spell slot per turn” rule.",['spells'],1lv610a,Casting a spell after being counterspelled

675,n2788cv,Yojo0o,"hey op. this is an oft-misunderstood corner of the rules, and as such, you've been given a lot of potentially misleading answers, or outright incorrect answers, mixed in with the correct answers. 

here's exactly the information you need:

assuming 2014 rules, per your flair, the pertinent rule is this one, found in the casting a spell section of chapter 10 of your phb:

>bonus action

>a spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. you must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. you can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

this rule is specific to bonus actions, and has no direct relationship to a number of leveled spells on a given turn. effectively, if you cast any spell as your bonus action on a given turn, leveled or cantrip, then you're otherwise limited on that turn to a cantrip with a casting time of one action. if you don't use a bonus action to cast a spell, you're otherwise allowed to blow as many spell slots on leveled spells as your action economy can spare: you could fireball, action surge, fireball, and then counterspell an enemy's reaction spell to your fireballs. 

in your given example, having cast a leveled spell with their action, the cleric is unable to use their bonus action on that turn to cast any spells. they could still cast other spells within their action economy, such as a reaction spell on that turn, or a second action spell if they're multiclassed with fighter and have action surge. 

if you're referring to 2024 rules, the pertinent rule is this one, found in the casting spells section of chapter 7 of your phb:

>one spell with a spell slot per turn

>on a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast a spell. this rule means you can’t, for example, cast a spell with a spell slot using the [magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#magicaction) action and another one using a bonus action on the same turn.

the important distinction here is not the casting of leveled spells, but rather the expenditure of spell slots to cast those spells. if you aren't spending spell slots on more than one spell, then you can fill your action economy with as many leveled spells as you want: you could cast misty step using a level 2 spell slot, then read a scroll of thunderwave to knock enemies away from you, and then move away from an enemy you didn't knock back, provoking an opportunity attack from that enemy, and then using your reaction to cast shield from your cube of force, for three leveled spells in a single turn, having only spent one slot.

in your given example, counterspell in 2024 rules prevents a spell slot from being expended on its target. per the quoted rule above, if you haven't expended a spell slot, then you're free to keep on casting. if you cast cure wounds, and you're counterspelled, then you can absolutely spend a spell slot to cast spiritual weapon on that same turn.",['spells'],1lv610a,Casting a spell after being counterspelled

681,n23ky6h,SoullessDad,"> not having lost a spell slot means no spell was cast
op’s question is asking about a spell that was countered. in 2024, the rule doesn’t say “you can only cast one spell”; it says that you can only expend one spell slot per turn. 

if you cast a spell without expending a spell slot, such as a racial spell or a spell using your 1/lr feature from fey touched, you can definitely still cast a bonus action spell that expends a spell slot under 2024 rules. spells from race and feats are much better as a result because they don’t stop you from casting other spells. 

the best example is fey touched and misty step. under 2014 rules, when you cast misty step as a bonus action, you’re locked out of casting other leveled spells this turn. under 2024 rules, if you’re using the 1/lr misty step, you haven’t spent a spell slot yet and can still fireball the location you just left.","['spells', 'feats']",1lv610a,Casting a spell after being counterspelled

685,n25cia2,Yojo0o,"come on, dude. it's okay to make a mistake, but doubling down doesn't help anybody.

as you can see, op has now edited their post to reflect the discrepancy, but originally included a mistake that your answer implicitly reinforced:

>i'm pretty sure, but i may be wrong, that if a character uses their action to cast a spell, and they are counterspelled, they cannot cast a spell with their ba. **~~with the exception of a cantrip~~** edit: i was accidentally flipping the action economy of leveled spells and cantrips writing this. the example is still what was being contested

by incorrectly stating that the limitation is on leveled spells, which i cannot stress enough *is not true*, you agreed with their assessment that a cantrip would be an exception. a cantrip is *not* an exception here, because the limitation is not on leveled spells, it's on bonus action spells. casting a leveled action spell precludes the casting of a bonus action cantrip on the same turn.

i'm not looking to dunk on anybody, i would just sincerely ask that you please not contribute to this pervasive misinformation that's been present in for the entirety of 5e's lifespan. there are many ways in 5e to cast multiple leveled spells in a single turn, and multiple exceptions to the proposed simplification that the rule might essentially mean ""cannot cast two leveled spells in one turn"".",['spells'],1lv610a,Casting a spell after being counterspelled

- then you start talking about moon druid in excitement, as if they aren’t the worst druid subclass starting in tier 2 or 3.

druids are incredibly strong, but the reasons why are because of their spells. that’s pretty much it. they have a lot of very strong battlefield control spells. 

entangle, spike growth, plant growth, sleet storm, conjure animals, wall of stone, transmute rock, wall of thorns etc. plus they come with a lot of the spells that make clerics good supporters. they get all of the best healing spells except for aid but get goodberry, they get pass without trace which is one of the best 2nd level spells in the game. they fall off a bit after level 11 with spell choices when other classes are getting insane spells, but conjure scaling keeps them relevant until they get options like reverse gravity, tsunami, and shapechange.

the other thing that keeps druids at the top is the fact that conjure animals is the best damage spell in the entire game, and it can even outdamage the most optimized martials with the right summons (though that depends on your dm).

if druids didn’t have conjure spells to give them top tier damage and battlefield control, they wouldn’t even be in the top 5. clerics, wizards, sorcerers, bards and paladins would likely top it. 

druids heavily lack in non-concentration options and damage otherwise. they have great control spells, and a great damage spell, but without conjure animals they’re just battlefield controllers with some support options.

the subclasses are good, but every caster class has good subclass options. there’s nothing groundbreaking in druid subclasses except for moon druid in tier 1. and of course shepherd druid shines, but that’s directly due to conjure animals. without conjure animals shepherd would be alongside all the other subclasses.  at will teleports with wildfire, great concentration with stars, best yoyo healing with dreams. those make druid more attractive but aren’t the main reason druids are good. their spell list is what makes them good.","['spells', 'class']",1m7pzrk,Druids are THE BEST class in general(5th edition specifically)

sorcerer is also huge because you can go divine soul and take on party healer spells and take the defensive disruption reaction spells.  blur, mirror image and the shield spell in combo allow you to tank effectively… as long as you have spell slots you can tank.  tack in the paladin dip for the armour and shields… and you have defence, disruption, healing and all kinds of utility.

if druids didn’t have conjure animals for damage then it would probably be clerics first. but being top tier controllers with the best damage spell in the game and not needing wisdom for any of those good spells is what keeps druids easily number 1 for a single class campaign.

i’m 53 and i don’t know if it’s from age or bitterness over decades of feeling like i’ve kind of failed myself musically but reading your post i think i am your warlock. i empathize with them. 

firstly if your situation is a curse or can be reversed somehow in game then the task is to reverse it. i’m assuming greater restoration won’t fix this. i don’t know if your patron took your music to punish you or it was just part of this fiendish deal. does your patron want back in with your character?

just like in real life i’m not sure in game how you get your music back but some thoughts come to me: 

warlocks jumping patrons is a cool concept. the fey like music too and this is a satyr after all. 

or maybe your dm would allow morphing your class entirely into a bard, which are also charisma based. if i were dming mechanically i would want you to maintain level with everyone else and this is something you’d have to work with your dm on for how to make it seem plausible in game, but it seems that inside your character the music already lives without the patron maybe?  again, you’re a satyr. 

think of the legend of robert johnson the blues god. the story was that he traveled around the south playing in barrel houses and bars and people didn’t think much of him. then he went away for awhile but next time he came through town he was fucking great, hypnotizing. the legend is that he had gone to the crossroads, made a deal with the devil to grant him success and proficiency in music and then he found that very thing, but most likely he just went away and practiced a shit ton. 

your character now does the same thing maybe but reborn as a bard . for the first time it’s his music not the genie’s or any other patron . they have to start over in a sense and find their own voice this time (and not at a lower level if i’m dming unless you gained bard levels back real fast) he’s learning to play, learning to sing again. think of the rocky movies if youve ever seen any of them. but if it’s some  curse  maybe none of this works?

also think of david bowie when he came with his ziggy stardust persona. before that he looked like a normal human. or bob marley before and after he grew the dreadlocks. they each became something else. and bowie and marley were two of the first to really define re-defining yourself. 

all this depends on the creativity and determinations of your dm. and i’ve never played a bard yet but they can be pretty badass. 

whatever happens if he does get music back make it be new music, a new sound. kind of like the old but something new like when bob dylan started going electric or what jimi hendrix was starting to do before he died, or like the beatles after they started smoking pot.",['class'],1lxxype,My Warlock lost his patron and his spark… what now?

751,n3qvcf3,PlayByToast,"for me it depends on the wizard's preparedness and personal temperament. if they know the fight is coming they'd have cast their defensive and/or summoning spells before the fight starts. from there an aggressive wizard would open with something near top tier, either singling out someone who looks fragile to drop quickly or going straight for aoe. if the wizard is more cautious they might shoot for a mid-level control spells before trying to take people out.


if caught unprepared, the aggressive wizard will likely go big or go home, try to injure their opponent so bad that they can't swing back too hard. a more cautious wizard would either go for defenses first or cast whatever spells they have to stall for time to get better prepared.


i usually have most wizards save their highest level spell slots for when they feel like it'll win the fight (the party leaves themselves exposed, they've figured out who the weak link is or the wizard thinks they're out of counter spells). they'll also usually have some means of escape held in reserve (something like misty step or invisibility). an experienced wizard also probably keeps a dispel and counter spell in reserve. outside of that, it's all-out use of whatever spells will bring victory as safely as possible.",['spells'],1m2homu,Question for DM's running an enemy wizard in combat

757,n3pb9ad,sh4d0wm4n2018,"if your wizard has access to the haste spell, or any sort of control spell, which a wizard built for combat should have, that's twice the number of spells they have access to *theoretically*. the main thing is to build your spell book to give you an equal amount of control spells and damage spells so you can continue dealing damage while preventing the enemy from taking action.

if the wizard is fighting the party, it's past the time for deliberation. obviously, spells 1-3 are not going to be ones you want to start out with, but 4-6 are good openers. you should never lead with a 9th level spell right out the gate since the party will still have resources. you want to burn their resources as fast as possible (think legendary resistances) while draining their hp at the same time.

one thing that isn't known in this scenario is what level the party is. that would be highly informative in running a  wizard against them.

personally, after giving this more thought, i think every enemy wizard (if they're solo) should be focused on getting away from the party as fast as possible. no reasonable person would expect to come out on top fighting an adventuring party by themselves, least of all a wizard, assuming the party has a solid chance of beating them.",['spells'],1m2homu,Question for DM's running an enemy wizard in combat
758,n13klxb,ASailingSloth,"spell slots are how the game limits the power level of spells you can cast and how often you can cast them in a day. if you’ve played video game rpgs, it’s a very similar concept to mana. it’s to prevent spellcasters from spamming powerful moves.

expending a spell slot means using one to cast a spell or perform a special feature of a class/subclass. once a spell slot has been used, it typically is gone until you take a long rest. let’s say i’m playing a level 3 cleric. my character would have four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots. this means my character can cast up to four 1st-level spells and two 2nd-level spells in a day. paladins can expend spell slots to use their signature ability, divine smite, which gives their melee weapon attacks extra radiant damage on top of the weapon’s usual type of damage.","['spells', 'class']",1lqklix,I'm supposed to play DnD tomorrow and I understand only the very basics

761,n13ibmx,Falbindan,"no need to be nervous! although that's pretty normal, especially before you play your first game. i know the rules look quite overwhelming at first but most of it will be pretty obvious after you started playing a bit. :)

most of these question, your dm can answer and i'm sure your bf would be thrilled to help you with everything if you ask. if you do like to be prepared, there are a couple of pretty good intro videos out there.

not to confuse you even more but there are several version of d&d out there. they will most likely be playing 5th edition with the 2014 ruleset. but just to be sure, confirm this with your boyfriend before looking at any rules! if you can tell us which version they are playing, i'm sure we can find some videos and help you learn the basic more easily.

does your boyfriend play the game in english or german? it will be easiest to learn the rules in the language you will be playing in as everything has been translated and therefore will be using different names.

to answer your questions (in 5e 2014 rules):

1. a spell slot is a resource you use to cast magic. a level 1 paladin has 2 spell slots. basically, this means you can cast 2 spells before taking a nap and recharging.

2. expending a spell slot means using it. if you cast one spell, you are expending one spell slot.

3. you do not have to do anything if you do not want to. but please keep in mind that dnd is a combat-focused game and combat will take a long time. if you do not want to participate, you will end up sitting around and doing nothing a lot. also, dnd is a cooperative game. your fellow players might not be too happy if you sit around not helping while they are dying. but this is something you need to discuss with the other players, not us. there is even a paladin subclass, oath of redemption, that would be fitting for a pacifist character. but again, the game is usually centered around combat and others might not like it if you refuse to fight.

4. charisma is the second most important stat for a paladin. it symbolizes your ""force of personality"", helps you convince (or lie to) others and - for a paladin - is the thing that makes your spells stronger. your charisma score is usually a number between 1 - 20. your charisma modifier depends on the score. example: if your charisma score is 14, your modifier is +2. this means, that if you roll a die to convince someone, you will add +2 to ""modify"" the result.",['spells'],1lqklix,I'm supposed to play DnD tomorrow and I understand only the very basics

3. stats / modifier.there's a big number and a little number with a plus that you'll use to add to various actions. ex: 16 (+3). add the +3 to an attack roll or a ""check""

763,n1452l3,No_Sympathy_1915,"honestly, i'd think a melee build without the magick elements might be better for a first time join. maybe a ranger or barbarian. they are build to deal/absorb damage and then get healed later.

spell slots: i'm no expert, but in short, every player that has magic gets spell slots. spell slots are the ""amount"" of spells you could cast between long rests (basically sleeping for the night). short rests (whatever you want to rp it) will often also restore most spell slots. expending a slot means you cast a spell at the level of the slots. example:  
you have a level 5 character who can cast 4 lvl 1 slots, 2 lvl 2 slots and 2 lvl 3 slots. you want to heal a player and cast a healing spell. usually a lvl1 spell could heal a lower amount of points, lvl 2 higher, lvl 3 even higher. so your barbarian has 2/30 hp. you cast healing on him at lvl3. he heals 19 points (this amount is usually determined by rolling dice). you now expend1 of your 2 lvl 3 slots, and have 1 lvl 3, 2 lvl 2 and 4 lvl 1's left. make sense?

cantrips are spells you can cast without available spell slots (sometimes you can upgrade a cantrip with higher level spell slots iirc)

charisma modifier: every character has about 6 attributes. strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisddom, charisma. you select certain attributes for your character (wizards usually high in wisdom and maybe intelligence, barbarians usually stronger, etc.). then during gameplay dm might ask you to do certain checks. you roll a dice, usually d20. the attributes you selected would be challenged (hence the roll). let's say you roll 16, have a +1 modifier, then your total would be 17. if you needed 17 or above to succeed, and this was the results, you succeed the check. dm would determine what that means, as it's linked to the specific situation.

hope this helps. i'm a noob myself but i understand it this way.

divine smite uses spell slots, so you probably wouldn’t be casting too many actual spells, which is where it can get tricky.

paladins *can* be tricky from a roleplay sense if your dm is strict about you sticking to your paladin oath, but since you’re mostly comfortable with the roleplay aspect and the dm will know you’re brand new and probably cut you some slack, i imagine it’ll be fine.","['spells', 'class']",1lqklix,I'm supposed to play DnD tomorrow and I understand only the very basics

767,n14juvn,awboqm,"most of the rules in role playing games are centered around combat since a) dnd is (designed as) a heroic fantasy game about fighting monsters and b) combat can’t be easily “acted out” like a roleplay. 

if you like roleplay but don’t love the rules or are having troubles with them, i’d suggest you play a class more designed around roleplay.  bard and rogue are great at out of combat scenarios as are most spellcasters if you make them. however, spellcasters are generally much more complicated (my friend always played rogue for the longest time because he didn’t understand spell slots at all). 

i usually recommend warlock if you want to learn magic, ranger for their versatility, or fighter for their simplicity. if you personally want to go for a paladin, you could make your character mechanically any one of these and flavor them to be some holy knight type. warlock’s spellblade has paladin-like features, though fighter (especially eldritch knight archetype) is more thematically similar to a paladin from the get-go. as for rogues, you may want to avoid them if you are dead set on being the moral compass.

on to your questions:
* as mentioned, spell slots are confusing. basically, the levels and features table shows you how many spell slots you get of each level. for example, a level 1 wizard has 2 1st level spells. at third level, the chart shows that they get 4 1st level spells and 2 second level spells. clearly (and extremely confusingly), the spell slot levels have nothing to do with your character level (beyond the amount that you get).  this 3rd level wizard can cast up to 4+2=6 spells until they recover their spell slots. they can cast spells of 2nd level or less because they don’t have larger spell slots. they can choose to cast a 1st level spell with a 1st level spell slot or their second level spell slot (often “upcasting” it for extra effect). this is the “lock and key” system. think of a 2nd level spell slot as being larger than a 1st level spell slot. you can stick a small 1st level spell (key) into its 1st level slot or you can fit it into a larger one. you cannot fit a large key into a smaller hole, so you cannot cast a 2nd level spell using 1st level slots. hopefully that clarifies it and if not, reply/dm me.
* to expend a spell slot is to use it. i cast a 1st level spell, expending 1 spell slot to do so. that spell slot can be 1st level or higher because of the “lock and key” system. 
* if you play a warlock, you don’t get many spell slots and if you don’t want to mess with them, you can just use the eldritch blast cantrip (and i’d suggest using your spell slots out of combat). if you play a fighter/ranger, you can make weapon attacks with your sword or bow.
* when you made your stats, you rolled 3 6sided dice and rolled, let’s say a 15. if you put this in charisma, this is your “charisma score”. dnd is weird because the scores are pretty useless. what is useful is the modifiers that they correspond to. in this case, a 15 corresponds to a +2 (round down (score-10)/2). you should put this in the cha box on your character sheet. if anything references your charisma modifier, it’s this number. ex: “your spellcasting ability is charisma and your spell attack modifier is your charisma modifier plus your proficiency” - if you make a spell attack, you would roll the d20 and add 2 for your cha, then add 2 for your prof (if you are lvl 1-4). 

ok, that was a lot.  at the end of the day, if you aren’t comfortable with certain rules, you can ask about them or don’t interact with them. during combat, it is expected that you may need some help and your bf should help you with this. you can always just ask him, “hey, i want to hurt this guy. how can/should i do that?”  he may tell you to cast xyz spell. you can then ask “can you walk me through that?”

tl;dr
1) ask for help at the table when you need it. 
2) if you want to play a “paladin like class”, i’d go with warlock if you are willing to try magic or go fighter if you are less sure about it. however, i believe ranger is the best class for new players. 
3) the questions you had were answered above. 
4) if you are still confused by anything, feel free to reply/dm me (though, keep in mind that i may not be checking reddit often today)","['spells', 'class']",1lqklix,I'm supposed to play DnD tomorrow and I understand only the very basics
768,n13ob9v,thatoneguy7272,"any spell caster might be a little complicated foe a first time player. i usually recommend monk or fighter for a first time player just because the only real option in combat is “i hit this thing”. if you really like the idea of paladin though you can absolutely go for it. they are a little more complicated but not too crazy. if the dm is good at their job, they should be able to guide you through most of it. 

i don’t know if your bf made one for you but there is a character sheet. this sheet has all the details and stats for your character. the main important things for your character will be located at the top and to the left. near the top, you’ll have your hp (health) and ac (armor class), only thing you really need to know here is that your ac is what an enemy has to roll to actually hit you. so when the dm asks you “does a 23 hit” you can look to that see if the number stated is higher than your ac and reply yes or know. if yes you will take some damage, if no, your character blocks it somehow. 

now the left side, it looks more complicated than it actually is. it gives you your stats. strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. these stats more or less determine what you are good at. there is the score and a modifier. the score will be a number between 3 and 20, this number will hardly ever come up but it determines your modifier. the modifier is a smaller number which will range from -4-5, this is what you will actually add to dice whenever your dm asks for a roll like this. additionally near the top of the page you’ll see another small box called “saving throws” this contains all of your normal modifiers but will also add proficiency two usually two stats, increasing the modifier. for a paladin its wisdom and charisma. add the number based off what your dm asks for, if they ask for a saving throw, use the upper box, if they ask for a check use the modifier next to your scores. 

next up are the skills, also located on the left. these are things your character can do in game. most of them should be auto populated for you again with a number between -4 and 15. if your try something in game the dm may ask you to make a roll using on of these skills. just find the modifier for the skill they call for and add it to your d20 roll. should be relatively simple and is usually in alphabetical order. sometimes it’s in mod order but that would be a little annoying to explain, so i won’t haha. 

outside of that the only other real thing to know if your weapon modifier and damage. usually located on the middle bottom, only things you really need to know a your to hit bonus and your damage: too hit bonus will be a smaller number you add to your d20 roll to see if you hit a monster. damage will be determined by your weapon and also add on your corresponding modifier. 

spell casting makes things a little more complicated. i cannot tell you much about them but i would highly recommend reading whatever spells you have available. they have specific things for them and what they do. 

tldr you don’t need to know any of this info, your dm should be able to walk you through it. but if you do want to know i hope this is helpful. the most important thing is just have fun. even with the rules present it’s a role play game, you can pretty much do anything. just try and stay in character and take some swings that make sense for the character and you should have a lot of fun.","['spells', 'class']",1lqklix,I'm supposed to play DnD tomorrow and I understand only the very basics
769,n1e7jig,ExperiencedOptimist,"that’s fine, the dm and more experienced players will help you out.

honestly i found i was very confused about the mechanics of dnd until i actually started playing it. just read your character sheet so you know roughly what’s there and don’t be too shy about asking

you don’t really need to get to focused on the details just yet bit to answer your specific questions:

a spell slot is a resource you spend whenever you cast a spell. think of it like arrows in a quiver, if you only have three arrows you can only shoot an arrow three times, right? so if you have three spell slots you can only cast three spells until you get some more (you get these back when you go rest). depending on your level it might be a bit more complex than that with spell levels, but your dm and boyfriend can help you out with that

paladins normally have spells, so you’ll will likely have spell slots

you don’t have to rush into fights, you can ask your dm for a ranged weapon and shoot from a distance if you feel more comfortable with that, but you’ll have plenty of time in combat to see what other players are doing and pick up how it works. you can always ask your dm whether you can do something or not. 

charisma is one of the six core stats that pretty much dictate how good your character is a doing stuff. charisma is pretty much how good you are in social situations. as a paladin, charisma also influences your magic. a modifier is the number you add to dice roll when you’re trying to do anything. so for example, if you’re trying to convince someone to help you will roll a dice and add your charisma modifier. this number will be noted in your character sheet

tl;dr: dnd is not a complicated game, you’ll pick up the rules naturally as you play, don’t worry. and if you are confused about anything, don’t hesitate to ask. i have players that i’ve been playing with for years that still need refreshers on rules all the time. you’ll be fine. hope you have a ton of fun :)",['spells'],1lqklix,I'm supposed to play DnD tomorrow and I understand only the very basics
770,n1o3yw4,LawfulNeutered,"on your turn say ""i move towards enemy x"" (at which point you move a distance up to your speed).  then ""i attack enemy x"" (roll a d20 and add your attack bonus to the number) announce the result; say ""i got a y"".  dm will say hit or miss.  if you hit, roll for damage (1d8 + your strength modifier) announce the result ""i do z damage"".  

paladins aren't the simplest class, but you can do the above pattern on every turn of every combat and still contribute/have a good time.  

also, spell slot is how you track how much magic you have left.  if you have 2 level 1 spell slots, and you cast a level 1 spell, you then have 1 level 1 spell slot remaining.  alternately as a paladin, you can smite using those spell slots.  after you hit a creature, say ""i'm going to use a level 1 smite"" (roll 2d8) then announce that along with your other damage.  

charisma modifer is how much your charisma affects stuff.  you have 6 ability scores (one of which is charisma) that all translate to a modifier that gets added to various rolls you make.  attack with a sword and add your strength modifier.  attack with a bow and add your dexterity modifier.

772,n13o97h,Arnumor,"i like to use a vending machine as a metaphor for spell slots in d&d.

imagine that your list of spells prepared is the list of available items on a vending machine.

now, think of your spell slots as tokens, which can be used to purchase a casting of one of the spells from the vending machine.

the caveat here is that this vending machine allows you to buy cheaper(lower spell level) items with your more valuable(higher spell level) tokens, but you can't add up change to buy more expensive items. instead, buying cheaper items usually improves the quality, to match the value of the token you spend.

so, your spell slots are currency, which you use to execute the effects of the spells that are available to you.

you can use a higher level spell slot to cast a lower level spell, which improves its effects as listed on the spell's description. some spells don't scale, of course.

775,n13poeg,SqtYork,"one of the cool things about d&d is that you can play a character with a lot of backstory or one without a backstory.  the game mechanics are the same.  the back stories just give you a basis for making choices in the actions you might take or what you might say.  or you can just make up your mind as you go along about the personality of the character.   paladins are religious warriors and tanks.  they smash things and prevent the enemy from to the rest of the group who are soft and squishy. spell slots are the limited number of spells at each level you can cast between long rests.  the higher level the spells the fewer of those you can use per day.  if you are starting out at 1st to 3rd level the paladin shouldn't have too many options for things you can do in one six-second combat round.  you will learn as you go.

a charisma modifier is a change to your dice roll. your character is a hero, not a common villager. they usually have good modifiers, like +1, +2, or +3 on their stats! charisma is one of those stats. by adding to your dice roll, you are increasing your odds of a good outcome.

all the subclasses are pretty good so go what feels right for the type of character you are making. if you go in with your goal is to learn the game and have fun, it's okay if you aren't making an optimized character imho. for spells i'd do a healing one (cure wounds), a smite or 2, and then whatever spell sounds cool to try out - command is fun. when deciding your god, it depends on setting but if you want to go with a good god that believes in forgiveness, bahamut might be interesting to you, tyr is a popular paladin god of justice, lathander has good vibes. it can get overwhelming with the gods, so if you wanted to start looking at those 3 that might be good. or so selune or sune if you want a goddess.

780,n3nw97w,Kurazarrh,"epic spells are a real pain in the ass to craft and cast, and our group ended up mostly shying away from them mostly due to the escalation in how much 3.5 turns into rocket tag as you get up toward level 8-9 spells. it was never fun when there's some huge encounter and the party wizard ends it all on the first round with one spell.

that being said, i think the coolest thing i ever crafted was using the make mythal seed. mythals are ""ancient elven magic"" that could essentially create a city-sized area of effect that could then have numerous other features added to it. we already had built ourselves a city that floated in the sky (not terribly uncommon in the setting we were in), and our dm was fairly infamous for really hammering the characters where it hurt (loved ones, etc). so i was really interested in making sure our city was impenetrable. so i did. the mythal had the following effects:

* spells with the [evil], [death], or [fire] descriptors cannot be cast in the city. the party and some other citizens are exempt from the [fire] restriction (and we can attune people to this exemption later as needed).
* the spell *blight* cannot be cast in the city.
* spells with the [teleport] descriptor cannot be used within the city except in specific zones, and even within those zones, evil creatures still cannot teleport. the party and city watch (a keyed, attunable feature) are exempt from this restriction.
* all non-evil creatures are constantly under the effects of the *fly* spell while in the city.
* all non-evil creatures can cast *cure light wounds* at will.
* evil outsiders and creatures who attack the city receive a *banishment* spell with a ridiculous spell resistance check and save dc when they enter the mythal's area.
* any creature that casts a spell from outside the mythal targeting an area, object, or creature inside the mythal gets hit with a *transdimensional bombardment* with a save dc of 33 every time they make such an attack. this also causes the mythal to consider the creature to have ""attacked"" the city for other purposes of the mythal.
* all evil creatures and creatures who have ""attacked"" the city are hit with *greater dispel magic* at caster level 20 when they enter the mythal's area.
* all creatures in the mythal's area can use the spell *tongues* as a 13th-level caster once per day.
* the party (and anyone else we choose to attune) is constantly under a *death ward* spell.
* all creatures in the mythal can cast *neutralize poison* at 5th caster level at will.
* all citizens in the mythal are constantly under a *delay death* spell at caster level 7.
* all creatures in the mythal can cast *light* at 1st level, at will.
* all attuned creatures (city watch, mostly) can cast *splinterbolt* as an 11th-level druid, at will.
* all citizens are able to cast *sheltered vitality* at caster level 7, at will.
* the party (and anyone else we designate) are constantly under a *detect scrying* effect at all times.
* all city watch/peacekeeping/militia members, plus the party, are exempt from the [teleport] ban and can cast *dimension door* at caster level 7, at will.
* any individual member of the party (most of whom were immortal by this point) can perform any of the necessary rituals to attune creatures to the various members-only features. additional creatures can be granted this specific ability only if all living members of the party are present and taking part in the ritual.

it was a pretty tough spell to cast, since we had to increase the spell's area by about 10,000%. since this was pretty much the end of the campaign anyway, we paid for it mostly by burning a ton of xp and taking a good chunk of backlash damage.

the mythal could also only be dispelled or disjoined by a caster who could beat a dc 62 caster level check, and the mythal was self-healing, so any dispelling effect that succeeded and couldn't cover the entire 1.8-mile radius with their attempt would cause the mythal to heal that dispelled area at something like a rate of 5ft per day or something.

790,mzm9y8p,Interesting-Ad4207,"so, the traditional party comp is a fighter, rogue, wizard, and cleric for a reason. that gives you enough frontline to take hits, enough single target damage to hit bosses, enough support to keep the party up, and enough aoe to deal with swarms. and out of combat, that gives you plenty of skills, utility spells, and healing to keep the party moving forward. while there is plenty of wiggle room in what classes you play, most games assume that you have rough equivalents to that party comp. if your party lacks one of those base roles, then your dm should work to either mitigate that loss(say not swarming a party that lacks good aoe options), shore up that weakness(say give your party an extra wand of fireballs), or otherwise make sure that the game fits your party, not punish the party for not fitting the game that assumes a larger party than you have.

  
that all being said, to answer the original question directly, if you only have the three players, perhaps taking classes that can fill multiple roles at least decently can help. like, i would suggest a paladin frontline, a druid caster, and an arcane trickster rogue. that gives you a frontliner that can tank, deal damage, and heal a bit. a caster that can both heal and aoe damage. and a rogue that can deal damage, have multiple skills, and have some basic utility spells.",['spells'],1ljr8af,How do you build a balanced three-PC party?

the buffed healing spells in 2024 vs 2014 so the spells all upcast / scale better, but it's still struggles for the aforementioned reasons.

803,mzop4fz,ELAdragon,"thanks for answering the questions.

scimitar goblins and morningstar bugbear means the encounter was difficult. i plugged it into an encounter calculator and it's a high difficulty encounter, but the overall numbers make it a bit more difficult. 

if you're playing a twf ranger with a nick weapon, you should have two attacks per turn every turn, while still having your bonus action open. if you were a hunter, you might have had a 3rd when multiple enemies were there with horde-breaker? monk has two attacks per turn, too, but also a bunch of special abilities. 

i'm not sure what the terrain looked like, but using ranged attacks and forcing enemies to come to you while you have an advantageous position is always advisable. keep the cleric clean, if you can. focus-fire is almost always the best strategy in dnd. things function as well at 1 hp as they did at full hp, so spreading damage out doesn't reduce enemy effectiveness...you reduce the amount of actions the enemy can take by reducing the number of enemies. focusing down the wolf and/or bugbear right away and then cleaning up the goblins would have been preferable. 

i don't have full details, so some assumptions:

1. monk should have used uncanny metabolism to heal and recharge all ki points to start combat. if you forced enemies to use a bunch of ranged attacks, the monk could have shined like crazy with deflect attacks in this encounter while taking out goblins left and right. and i still don't even know the monk's subclass.

2. with twf and horde-breaker you could have focused fire on the wolf/bugbear (hunter's mark, too) while also whittling down goblins. once they closed to melee, of course. 

3. cleric needs to cast more. sounds like this was the boss fight...smoke 'em if you got 'em when it comes to spells. unsure of their subclass, which is a big deal since many have awesome abilities at 3rd level. a light cleric has an aoe. war clerics can make multiple attacks and basically auto-hit a couple times. those would have been huge. heals while bonus action attacking with spiritual weapon, or bless (bless with a group of pcs who make multiple attacks is really good).  then cleric stays protected behind y'all so he (hopefully) doesn't have to make a ton of concentration checks. he should pop out of cover, shoot, go back behind cover, if it's available.

if there are more details or you have more questions, lemme know. learning how to play the ""game"" part of table-top role playing games is definitely important. there is an element of player skill that matters, even if that gets overlooked at times here.",['spells'],1ljr8af,How do you build a balanced three-PC party?
804,mzmprkv,firewater_87,"yes, focused fire is definitely better than splitting damage. 

most combata come down to positioning and management of action economy.

you as players have  specific resources every turn in your action, bonus action, reaction, and concentration (where applicable), the most important obviously being your action. but being able to do something worthwhile consistently with your bonus actions and reactions can also make a big difference. 

so your party has 3 members, when you start facing hoards of enemies like this, even weak ones, the scales tip fast at early levels.

every enemy represents that same breakdown of actions that you have (more or less) so 7 goblins means every round is 7 actions to your 3. the faster you can start reducing/ eliminating enemy actions the better. this is why aoe and crowd control(and health lol)  is so important. they ""even the odds"" but as already mentioned,  the level of spell you'd need to have handled this wasn't available to you yet. there are low-level spells that could have helped 100% (sleep, shatter, burning hands, thunder wave) but i honestly don't think it would have mattered here. this is still 100% a dm balancing issue, but at least it's led you here to talk some theory crafting and tactics

when playing in person at my home game, my players were having trouble with this sort of thing, so i started printing out references for their spells, abilities, and items, at first. i called them cheat sheets.

eventually, we wanted something a little bit better, so i did some digging, and found out about [a bit of free software called magic set editor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/magicseteditor/), which is originally meant for making your own mtg cards, but can be handy for making spell and item cards, with the right templates.

after that, i found [this template pack by a user named tintagel](https://www.wargamevault.com/m/product/139323), which not only includes very useful templates for 3 different styles of cards for d&d items and spells, but also has an entire collection of spell cards ready-made, in a collection you can find included on his product page. he also includes a template for placing the card images on a print-ready pdf. 

we printed these out on cardstock at our local library, and used a [sliding paper cutter similar to this one ](https://business.walmart.com/ip/paper-cutter-slider-paper-cutter-paper-trimmer-paper-classroom-small-cutter-a3-a4-cutter-switchblade-sliding-clipping-tool-convenient-and-safe-blue/9749570713?gqt=1) to cut them out cleanly, and end up with each player having their own deck of cards for their abilities, items, and spells.

my players loved this solution, and it made things much easier for them to keep track of. also, it's just fun having physical artifacts like this at the table.

these are standard sized cards, which means you can put them in any kind of trading card organizers that one might normally use for mtg, pokémon, or baseball cards, what have you.

so i broke the fight down to 3 fights, pcs vs bbeg (pc fight), drake vs bug (kaiju fight), and coalition army vs drow army (infantry fight), these fight happen simultaneously. since the soldiers of the drow army and coalition army use the same stat block, i automated it with a bit of math and dice. while the pc fights are happening, they can influence the outcome of the infantry fight by taking down defenses or weakening the wall, etc.

now the fun part, i didn't use any special mechanic, i let them power build, and i know my players love a cinematic, high-stakes fight with high-intensity, and brutal fights. so...   
the cinematic part is the kaiju fight in the background. and when an enemy dies, i sometimes let them ""ragdoll"" for a bit for that impact feel. for example, when they kill the avatar of lolth, miz'ri. i send her flying 15 feet through a building.   
since the fight is going to be high intensity, the enemy going to throw around 75-100 damage per turn per enemy, and a 2-page long statblock of abilities and features to throw at the pcs. and for the brutality part, if a pc is down, i will finish them off, counterspell healing spells, and mutilate the corpse so that revivify doesn't work. this helps keep people on their toes and engaged. they have to pay attention when they get low because if they get down, it is very hard to get them back up.

866,n4f01uk,TiFist,"they're not the only bard that's towards the higher end of the power scale, but it's absolutely impossible to discount the level 6 extra magical secrets.  you're getting fireball only one level behind what a wizard/sorcerer/light domain cleric does, and it's one of those spells that starts out way ahead of the power curve and never becomes useless.  so you have all the versatility of the bard and one big hitting heavy damage spell.  you can use the 2nd magical secrets spell for something non-offensive (counterspell highly recommended) but getting one big boom early on is huge.  if your party is stacked with other magic users, you have options.  that's the point-- the lore bard is one of the most ""you can do what you want"" classes out there. 

level 10 is at the point where many campaigns have already ended or will end soon, so that's fine-- but it's not as useful as getting the spells much earlier.

cutting words is also a great ""no you didn't"" option-- like silvery barbs you can effectively cancel out critical hits against you or your party, or any other attack where it would be really bad if it hit.  you have a generous amount of bi and can throw those around pretty freely, especially if you think you can do short rests.",['spells'],1m5vc7g,Why Lore Bards?

lore bards imo aren't there to seduce everything in sight.  they are perhaps the one class / subclass combo that is the ultimate adventurer.  no matter where they go, it just makes *sense* for them to be there because they don't need any reason other than piqued interest.

871,n4i0lrk,therosx,"here are my thoughts as a bard enthusiast who didn’t like the 5e bard compared to the 3.5 bard.

that said, the changes they made with 5.5e solved most of the issues for me. i’m playing a glamor bard and loving the healing and temp hp features. especially when combined with the magic initiate feats from cleric and wizard to get bless and mage armour. both of which should have always been on the bard spell list in my opinion. also haste which should have been a no brainer.

the new true strike solves the melee attack problem although i would have preferred a bard spell that would have allowed them to turn a mystical instrument into a cha based weapon similar to shillelagh.  

the first reason lore bard is considered “best” is because the bard spell list kind of sucks. there should be more buff and utility spells. magical secrets helps with that and reaching level 6 is far more common in games that level 10.

second is the best reason to pick valour or swords is to get the armour and shield proficiencies which can be done by a one level dip into a martial class instead. 

third is there are two other cha classes that are competing with bard. sorcerer and warlock. both can be a “better” bard and do the same things a bard can do, while also being better in and out of combat.

with those options available lore bards are the best option if you aren’t going to multi class in my opinion.

the short version:

crawford tweets yes it can in 2015

crawford tweets no it can't in 2016 with an addendum of ""nothing can cancel a crit""

except that stuff \*can\* cancel a crit.

this ignores that at least two other options can cancel crits-- including warding flare which is also in the same 2014 book  (not a guarantee since it just imposes disadvantage but rolling 2 nat 20's is 1 in 400 odds) and silvery barbs which came later.

it was never fixed in errata to my knowledge, just the sage advice which was treated as an official ruling

it was never fixed in 2024,

there are also cases that you encounter more often with targets with high ac and higher level bards with a bigger bi die and a lucky roll, but following raw, you can turn a nat 20 into a miss, and if you can turn it into a miss, how can you apply damage?  nothing says you can't apply cw to a nat 20 anywhere.  it just says that you can turn a success into a failure.

i'm firmly on the side of crawford messed up this one, and most tables i've ever experiences are \*ambivalent at best\* towards much of what jeremy crawford tweeted and allows a cw to cancel a crit.  most people don't play adventurer's league and i would expect a different level of rules lawyering there.  your mileage may vary, and your dm may be a stickler and rule that cw (unlike warding flare and silvery barbs) is insufficient to cancel a crit.  i absolutely don't read raw or rai that way.

if nothing else could cancel a crit and a crit was absolute and immutable, then why can other abilities and spells nullify it?",['spells'],1m5vc7g,Why Lore Bards?
884,n4jk94w,TiFist,"that depends on how much stock you put in a tweet from jeremy crawford nine years ago after a tweet 10 years ago when he says that it does.  it's an argument of rai vs raw and just the way a dirty 20 isn't a natural 20.  warding flare has a high chance of cancelling a crit (and was never crawforded despite also being in the 2014 phb) and as a channel divinity, it's a roughly equivalent skill.   silvery barbs definitely cancels a crit.

i've never, \*ever\* played at a table where cw does not cancel crits.

if the game cared, they would have specified in the 2024 rules, if you believe the 2014 rules are imprecise.  they didn't:

""you learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. when a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a reaction to expend one use of your bardic inspiration; roll your bardic inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.""

for a non-crit, you can definitely turn a successful attack roll into a miss.

let's assume a deer attacks you (using something with an arbitrary low + to hit of +2) and rolls a natural 19.  your armor class is 18. that's a hit at 19 before the + to hit is applied.  you use a cutting words and roll a 6, reducing the attack to a 13, and it's now a miss even with 13+2.  that's not controversial at all.

now let's assume a deer attacks and rolls a natural 20.  nothing there says you can't still use cutting words.  you use cutting words and reduce the attack by 6.  your armor class is 18, and the modified 20 is now a 14.  14+2 is a miss.  there's no successful attack to which double damage dice can even be applied.

there are cases that are more likely in an actual game where the reduced attack roll would still result in a hit with an enemy with a high enough + to hit or a target with a low enough ac (instead of a deer at +2 it's a dire wolf at +5 so you reduce that nat 20 + 5 to a 19 (assuming the same roll of 6) which still hits... if you believe that the crit property still occurs in that case, that's between you and jeremy crawford.",['class'],1m5vc7g,Why Lore Bards?
885,n4khtu4,TiFist,"i can understand that justification completely that the abilities that trigger a reroll (or maybe even disadvantage) work differently.

i just read this is as a specific-beats-general case based on the wording.  the wording specifically stating that it can turn a success into a failure without any specific carve out for critical hits in combat is something i interpret to mean that it can modify an attack roll, including a natural 20.  i mean if this confused jeremy crawford back in the day, i think it's fair to say that the raw are unclear in the 2014 phb, and barring a crawford tweet, it's up to the dm to determine if rai is that crits always hit and cannot be cancelled by cutting words or if cutting words is another class of abilities that can cancel crits as a specific-beats-general case.

i understand that al and other highly-rules-adherent groups would adjudicate a 2014 game as that it can't based on the 2nd tweet.  (i guess if you played an al game in the \~3 months between the tweets it would have been adjudicated the other way.

so holding that it's unclear in 2014 is one thing-- i could be wrong, and it is unable to cancel crits per 2014 because the ability does not trigger a reroll, but it's certainly something that came up as being unclear and needing to be addressed.

then nothing happened and the 2024 rules still leave it unclear.

i'd say two things:  even if it's raw and rai that it not cancel crits, it's still one of those things that's commonly house ruled-- like critical success skill checks (although that's a very clear not-raw case).  see how your table adjudicates it.  two: this really needs an errata to clarify.  maybe the words ""potentially turning a success into failure"" are just too open to interpretation.",['class'],1m5vc7g,Why Lore Bards?

890,n20670h,bastian_1991,"i don't understand why this is getting downvoted. this has happened to many people and we should offer the best advice we can.

things that i would do: read your class features and spells again. have wildcards with mini-summaries or key info on post-its or something that can be a quick reminder of specific things.

another thing i'd recommend is trying to enjoy the roleplay more than combat, and if the group you've been playing with is more combat-oriented, perhaps try with a different group or dm that puts less effort into the fighting aspect of d&d even if it's just for trying.

as far as usage of spells go, the rule of thumb is the spell does what it says it does quite literally. if you read something and have an idea that doesn't fully get covered by the spell text, the most likely ending is: it can't be used in that way. however, asking your dm in advance is something you can do before you select the spell, so you feel like the spell isn't wasted.

for clerics, you can change your spells daily, same with druids. they know all the spells available to them and can prepare them after every long rest. so if you try something and it doesn't convince you, you can change it the next in-game day, which is handy and neat.

wizards have to learn them and put them in their spellbook and then they can memorize/prepare some for the day, among the pool of spells written in the book.

bards can only have a smaller selection of spells, much like warlocks or sorcerers, but they all can also change at least one spell every level up, so if something doesn't work, later you'll have a chance to switch it for something else. it takes a lot of irl time between level-ups so this isn't the most optimal but still, it's better than not being able to change them at all.

rule of thumb: if you come up with an outside-the-box idea, talk to your dm about it, they should always be good to at least consider and discuss it. they will have the final say. if this keeps happening a lot where you think a spell does something and it is decided it doesn't, you either need to change tables, or keep asking for advice on social media (try sage advice as well, that's a good tool). this will help you know how different people interpret different versions of a text. erratas happen all the time, by the way. where people keep interpreting a spell in one way and then it does something else.

i had to leave a table because my dm kept shutting down my spells saying that's not how they worked, in the raw (read as written) 2014 rules, and most of them were re-written in 2024 and they do more clearly exactly what i thought they did. so i was ""right"" all along, in the sense that they were rai (read as intended) what i thought they were. it is always good to clarify with the community on a case-by-case basis for spells.

tldr: learn your spells, give yourself reminder notes, consult the community to know what each spell does where it's unclear, talk to your dm about doubts, and try different dm styles and tables that aren't so focused on combat, just for a change, then decide what kind of game you want to play.","['spells', 'class']",1luqof7,My Characters Always Fall Flat

you're one of the handful of main characters in the story. your person isn't infringing on the dm's world by being more than a blank slate, they are inhabiting the world. short of bringing a character who was isekai-ed to another world by truck-kun, there is some amount of leeway any dm and group will give to the players to get a character they can jell with (and even the isekai anime trope character can be appropriate at a smaller fraction of tables, if that's the agreed tone).

don't be afraid of big boisterous flavor, especially in one shots. you're not bound to hold up that energy for more than a session or two.

mechanically, use the flavor to paint your decisions. go for the mechanically strong options when they make sense, and add a layer of flavor with the other character options. following guides is fine for a way to come to grips with how a character operates, to not feel weak from the start, and just take the more flavorful options for stuff not as heavily tied to optimizing the character for combat.

you mentioned not hitting with the cleric as an example. were you going for a melee build? did you dump your strength or wisdom or constitution to get there? swinging the weapon adds a whole other stat to care about, and makes it harder to fit being especially smart, nimble, or charismatic.

concentrating on spirit guardians is a huge source of your damage as a melee cleric. you're still a full caster, on top of swinging your holy mace. the spells do the work of keeping pace with the fully martial characters, both offensively and defensively. come out miles ahead on out of combat utility.

for a ranged back liner cleric wisdom is just about the only thing to care about. it affects all of your ability to hit from range. then constitution for hp and concentration saves. just enough dexterity or strength to maximize your armor.

have a concentration spell default option in mind, your ranged cantrip and maybe a melee cantrip or melee weapon, and other leveled spells to cover buffs, healing, debuffs, nuking, and utility as needed. be a bit picky for what you want to be good at, but for a caster if you maximize your choice of concentration spell and your default attack cantrip, you are 90% effective.",['spells'],1luqof7,My Characters Always Fall Flat
898,n22jquw,Qzrei,"so my first tip is to stop thinking about the classes as classes.  what i mean is, this one time i played a character based on the old norse völva, basically a seer/witch.  to her, she was a witch. a played her like a witch. the group and dm all saw her as a witch.  mechanically? a bard. another bard i played was just some random dude who got swept into the story.  the first ultra hyper customized character he met, he freaked tf out and was convinced it was a demon. i played up his low wis and decided to really use his skill set as his main focus for *everything*.  combat? what skill can i can use.  social? what skill can i use? any and every situation, i first considered the skill set.  he was, after all, just some dude.  and the same thing goes with every other class.  so figure out who you want to play, then work the mechanics to suit.  

my next tip.  hand write your character sheet with relevant information first. relevance is determined by how you want to play your character.  homicidal maniac? all your combat info, first page.  skill monkey? all the neat tricks you can do, first page.  whatever organization method you choose should prioritize how your character acts in different situations.  you don't even have to keep all the skills together in one chunk.  you can strew them throughout the sheet/s to suit your whim or omit them entirely.  

third, dnd is a game and as much as everyone wants to be brilliant all the time, in every situation, it likely isn't going to happen.  know your table and fellow players.  there's going to be at least one character who *loves* to shine in combat and wants to get the highest dmg and have the most hits, etc..  let them.  if it's in your character's nature, get some spells to help them get those super high, ungodly, making the dm question their decision level attacks.  you can shine in an area where you want to, just know the table and how your character can contribute.  

fourth.  build does not determine personality and it never should.  sure there are tropes and some tropes can be fun but they get boring. a  back stabbing tiktok influencer can absolutely have sticky fingers. maybe the new-age artsy fartsy hippie has some *very* strong values and flies into a rage from time to time. charismatic mega-church leaders? zealous cultists? absolutely struck a deal with some powerful being & i can absolutely see a gambling addict loading up on save or suck spells. 

but all of it boils down to who your character is, not what.  when you have the 'who' nailed down, it won't matter if your spells hit great or flop. it won't matter if your character hits like an anemic school child so long as it's true to the character you want to play.

900,n27l7pj,spacehamsterblitz,"a lot of people have given some really great actionable advice. i’ll throw in that it’s not really helpful to compare yourself to other players! you are the only you at the table, and that’s valuable in and of itself. people make mistakes and sometimes the dice don’t work in your favor! i’m mildly dice-cursed and i was in a campaign with a dm who loved to punish nat 1s, imagine being a rogue who rolled a 1 on stealth without reliable talent 😔 devastating.

being around people with more experience who seem to just have a knack for something can be super intimidating. have you ever asked any of them for some help? or if that’s too daunting, ask how they came up with their ideas instead? ime creative types love to talk about their little guys, and a lot of the time they’ll be eager to explain their process.

for real, dnd as a game has a ton of rules to learn and flubbing them is easy. a cleric always has access to all their spells! that’s so many spells to remember!! i know 5e rules so well and i still find that nerve-wracking. this will probably get me sent to the oubliette for saying it but what helped me get a grasp on rules and spells and all of the fiddly stuff was watching/listening to a lot of actual plays. learning from other people, both at your table and at other tables, is super valuable. it depends on your learning style, tho—i’m super adhd and struggle with walls of text.

anyway. make cheat sheets, double-check your spells before you cast them, and if you’re unclear about something ask a person or the old internet searchamajig. chances are someone else has had the same question, and there may even be a crawford tweet about it. there are also just tons and tons of blogs and threads and sites about good options for characters, tho i personally would take them with a grain of salt when it comes to musts and bests and so on because if we all only chose the “best” option for everything we’d all be playing the same guy. good luck, you got this! experience is the best teacher!",['spells'],1luqof7,My Characters Always Fall Flat

forging is a very specific form of material working (you can’t “forge” wood and most organic materials, a casted object isn’t technically “forged”, and i’d argue summoned weapons and materialized from a magical plane and thus not created but called upon). 

“hands”? i mean, come on. too open ended. think like a genie or monkey’s paw.

i've never much cared for language based magic. i find it unsatisfying to quibble over the definition of weapon, forged, mortal, or hands. instead ask why, at a fundamental level, most things can't hurt or kill him?

in lotr, there's nothing that actually stopped anyone from killing angmar other than his considerable combat ability. he didn't have some anti-man shield. someone with foresight simply saw that it would be a woman to do him in. 

with vampires, they are taint or contamination. you can't beat them to death because you can't punch the metaphysical filth out of existence. salt, silver, sunlight, and running water kill vampires because they are purifying. they clean and cure the sickness that is a vampire. this is also why many modern interpretations make vampirism a literal pathogen. 

in that light, perhaps weapons are also tainted by nature. a thing made for violence carries that ill-intent within it. you can't use that to kill the vampire in the same way you can't burn a fire. so if you wanted, maybe an object not made for violence would work. but if you find that unsatisfying, maybe it takes something more. maybe you need an object made with benevolent intentions.

""prophecy twists"" are fun, but i don't think you should go out of your way to accommodate them just because.  if you players think of something genuinely clever then go for it, but it's not the sort of thing that should be rules-lawyered.  whoever designed the prophecy in-universe was probably not going through every possible meaning of the sentence and making sure the vampire was cursed to be vulnerable to every single possible interpretation.  if anything, they saw he had general immunity to everything except the one specific thing that gets the job done and worked backwards from there.",['weapons'],1lkzec3,"Does the ""No weapon forged by mortal hands can kill me"" trope apply to everything mortals make or could I beat the shit out of a vampire with a coffee table since it's not technically a weapon?"

that said, your point is still valid. a lot of tolkien's works end up having themes of ""evil tends to self-sabotage"" and ""good prevails through action"" - and the witch-king was so confident that he was invincible that he allowed himself to be openly attacked, and then merry and eowyn acted.

974,n2gjzgz,Zagmit,"i see that a lot of people view this as acceptable re-flavoring, but i feel like it crosses a line and grants too much in the way of mechanical benefit. 


i feel like there's a problem where the player wants to have their damage maximized via 'flavor' without engaging with the narrative or mechanics of how weapons work in d&d. theoretically a hexblade warlock could summon either a dagger or a great sword, but letting a player remove that choice and simultaneously maximize their potential damage isn't flavor, and might look like favoritism. 


i also feel like it might become a problem as soon as you try to describe this to your other players, who don't have a character option that similarly would let them just maximize potential damage. everyone else at your table will be expected to abide by how the game works where bigger weapon equates to more damage dice, but then one player gets to subvert that because they made a bad argument about how they *could* have used a bigger weapon, even though they chose not to. 


additionally, i feel like you would very quickly run into some issues with how this kind of things impacts gameplay, even if you think you can avoid it. for instance, you might normally consider the possibility of a player using a dagger to pick a lock, or a great sword to smash a lock open, which is it going to be in this case? also, how does this dagger that's not a greatsword get treated in social or stealth situations? is the warlock going to be treated differently than one of your other players that actually uses a big weapon? ",['weapons'],1lwkm3h,Player Wants To Reflavor Her Greatsword

""little did he know i pull the dagger from my coat pocket."" sure you can shunt it to a space but thats an action to bring it back your not ambushing someone whos looking at you like you can by simply pulling a dagger sized object from some cloak or coat to catch someone off guard. it also can inhabit more space, say the cave walls make wielding a heavy weapon undesirable suddenly this dagger greatsword circumvents that.

if your a gm who doesnt factor in the size of the ceiling and let your players know whats up with the room and dont use the environment a lot or you dont have many places where weapons are often left with bouncers or guards it wont matter and i say allow it.

in my sort of game (not that it matters) the environment matters somewhat and i let players know environmental info as they enter rooms so they arnt caught off guard. like our last session my fighter started punching kobolds cause his greatsword got lodged in the roof of the old shack, he knew it was a possibility if the attack roll was too low before hand but he said ""screw it we ballin"" and it got stuck haha so he laughed and said ""back to basics then"" and started punching and using kobolds as weapons. its often common practice in meetings with mayors and such if the city or town has a strong law presence to take larger military grade weapons such as polearms and arming swords and replace them with small daggers or clubs until the party grabs their gear to return to the wilds in some places.  so dagger greatswords wouldnt work for me for example unless a magic weapon found somewhere.

as a hexblade most their damage is from charisma anyway... but i suppose as a paladin lover myself, crits are more fun with more dice.

maybe be player should opt for a rapier or short sword. they can be concealed easier, do only half to 3/4 of max damage of a two handed great sword, and can be much easier concealed.


edit: in real life great sword is a renaissance weapon, when they finally managed to come up with metal mixes to make large swords that would not break in combat. 
in middle ages, lances, pikes, spears, maces, flails and mourning stars were primary weapons and daggers and short swords were much more likely backups on the battlefield.

992,n2gxuzq,aquirkysoul,"my general rule is that basically anything about a class is fine to be re-flavoured (if you run it by me first) as long as you understand that mechanically you are still wielding a greatsword.

my suggestion would be that you and the player agree to pact restrictions that keeps their other hand occupied when wielding their exceptionally deadly dagger - perhaps the hexblade likes its user to do crazed two hand stabs. or maybe the entity within the blade refuses to be conventionally hidden, to prevent the character sneaking it past guards without dismissing/resummoning the blade. minor inconveniences that happen to do the same thing as ""carrying a greatsword"" would do - to aid in the rp and to keep it fair for everyone.

honestly though - hexblades are the easiest to justify for this reflavouring, as the around bonded/pact weapons give you plenty of ways to cheat already.

non hexblade example: bards use instruments as their focus. my bard is a storyteller, not a musician - i don't want instruments involved at all. so, with my dm's permission, i flavoured my bard so that he always keeps an hand free (the one he'd otherwise be using to tap a beat out on hand drums). mechanically, very little has changed - but the flavour is more to my taste his spells are cast with arcane gestures, true names and magic words, rather than via the power of rock.","['spells', 'weapons', 'class']",1lwkm3h,Player Wants To Reflavor Her Greatsword

1000,n2fius8,Abel_Skyblade,"daggers being shit even with dual wield makes the damage argument compelling. i would love just doing a single dagger and empty offhand rogue for rp. but mechanically the game punishes that decision with way lower damage on average. steering people towards using rapiers. 5.5 does offer some more compelling options for low damage weapons. and its certainly a step in the right direction; there are just some builds that while the rp sounds really fun, they are not really supported easily for non min max players.


an example: magical spearman that is a light and agile warrior. you could almost force it with 4 elements monk but that is not a caster, also unarmed doesnt fit so unless you gimp yourself by ignoring it then what do you do? 
eldritch knight its close but spears being str based dampers the agile dex based fantasy. you could dip 1 level to monk but that is just awkward and feels kind of min maxy for most people(i dont think it is tho) 

bladesinger is perfect but it doesnt allow using 2h spears, spears arent dex based, etc. using a spear is honestly suboptimal as shadow blade is better and dual wielding it is even better. allowing finesse spears or reflavoring a rapier doesnt cost anything i would even allow polearm master on it. becuase of the simple reason that whatever marginally better martial damage any player can do its meaningless in the face of stronger magical options. as a dm i want my players to have fun, i want them to struggle in combat, think of cool solutions, be afraid and feel like badasses when they succeed. mechanically limiting martials too much is a bias that too many dms have. i treat martials as superhumans, as long as they are willing to roll for something and it makes some degree of sense i let them try and reward them for it. it even got to the point that casters get way more creative and they end up investing more time really learning how to use their spells in unexpected ways in battle.



another example, a player of mine wanted to build their warforged storm sorc around having shocking grasp as a consistent damaging option. shocking grasp as it stands is kinda situational and he is already rushing meele range for it. i kept damage and level scaling as it is. but allowed him to upcast the cantrip by spending spells slots to add repeated attacks. i balanced it kinda like magic missiles in regards to the attack quantity. its not really that strong tbh. does basically a lot of damage to a single target depending on how many spellslots he uses. he could be more useful using hypnotic pattern or something aoe. but thats not what he finds fun.  now he is happy running around as a magic robot that can electrocute enemies that get too close. he even bought a belt of dwarfkind to be more ""tanky"" and is now focusing on close range spells and doing a ""meele storm sorcerer"" flying into meele range a bursting people down. i do these small requests for all my players because in the end even if they are a bit op, i can always add more monsters or slightly more hp or enemy damage to adjust the challenge to its intended level for my party.","['spells', 'weapons']",1lwkm3h,Player Wants To Reflavor Her Greatsword

i'd say not broken at all, a little stronger than a simple martial weapon, but not by much.

it's also situational - it's not strong against swarms, and you're not free to pivot and attack another target mid-combat like normal weapons. plus you have no burst damage, so it's not good for surprise attacks. generally you want melee combats over quickly, but this only works for long combats so you risk getting hit a lot.",['weapons'],1llip58,I need someone to help do the math to prove how broken this Magical weapon is to my brother

1038,mzzy8vd,lygerzero0zero,"er, what’s the situation here? who’s the dm? is someone proposing this as an item they want?

it definitely should have an upper limit on the amount of dice, just because it’s a good idea in general to prevent shenanigans. also does this ever reset? if you stab a recurring enemy once, then that enemy comes back a month later, do you still have that bonus? it’s a kinda lazily designed homebrew that doesn’t consider sane safeguards or how this item would play at the table.

that said, depending on the level of the character and the class they’re playing, it might not be super broken. a high level fighter with 4 attacks a turn could get out of hand, but it’s pretty balanced for a rogue only making one attack a turn, when fights rarely last more than three rounds. it should still have an upper limit and some time limit on the bonus as well.",['class'],1llip58,I need someone to help do the math to prove how broken this Magical weapon is to my brother
1039,n0386do,KadanJoelavich,"it looks to be situationally useful. the biggest problem is that there is no upper limit or duration bounding. if you are a standard martial with 1-3 attacks per turn (depending on level, feats, features, etc.), you can get about an average of +5 damage by the end of your first turn. if you are fighting  a horde of kobolds, that is functionally useless; it's basically just a dagger. 

where this would really shine is against high-health bosses.  a max level fighter could make 5-6 attacks per round. assuming ~4 of those hit on average, you would permanently increase your average damage by 10 each round. so first round: 1d4, 2d4, 3d4, 4d4, or ~2.5 + 5 + 7.5 + 10= ~25. second round 4d4, etc, for ~ 12.5 + 15 + 17.5 + 20 = ~65, third round: ~22.5 + 25 + 27.5 + 30 = ~105. that's still an average of ~65 damage per round over three rounds (combat usually only lasts ~3 rounds). that's high, but not shockingly so; a well-built martial can achieve that kind of average damage per round with mundane weapons.

the biggest problem i see with this is the potential for cheesey shenanigans. since there is no time limit, you could go poke a dragon, run away, long rest, come back the next day, and do it again. after a few weeks of this, your character would be doing like 30d4 damage on a hit, and you could just take the thing out in one round. obviously, this assumes you are dealing with a very stupid dragon or a very well organized team with lots of magic options for entry/escape. it needs a clause to remove all stacked damage after any short or long rest, or even when you roll initiative, so that its effect is limited in scope. alternatively, if it had a maximum, like 8d4, that would also limit 'creative' player bs.","['weapons', 'feats']",1llip58,I need someone to help do the math to prove how broken this Magical weapon is to my brother

make it so that the effect resets if your bro attacks another target or ""loses an edge"" if he spends a turn without attacking with the dagger. if this is on a rogue, then they only get one attack per round (maybe 2 with a reaction) and it results in a slight damage boost. their main damage will still be from sneak attack.

1042,n00nbbh,ShiroSnow,"i genuinely think it sounds like a solid, but annoying weapon. i would personally add a few restrictions; it can get one stack maximum per round, attuned to by a rogue, and maybe only works for melee. this last one would depend on what other magical items the party has. 

it's not going to come into play often. how many times does a target last more than 3 rounds? how much damage overall is it adding to each of their turns. even bosses, i don't imagine that it will reach 5 stacks often. it will be awesome when it does, though.

if we look at a 5th level rogue. typical dagger + sneak attack combo. (18dex assumed)

1d4+4 + 3d6
6.5 + 10.5 = 17 damage per round average. 
if we add 1d4 (2.5) that takes us to 19.5 > 22 > 23.5.
this assumes 100% sneak attack activation.

a level 5 fighter typical round (1 handed longsword, 18 str)
[1d8+4)2 = 17.5
before any other bonuses fighters may get.

the difference isn't much at the start, but once we include bonuses like +1 / +2 weapons, maneuvers, and subclass abilities, the fighters damage is going to keep up. add in great weapon master / sharpshooter the divide grows more. at level 11 when the tripple attack comes in, sneak attack gets upgraded, the bonus becomes even smaller. they will also be sacrifice the +x to hit in exchange for just damage. 

a flametongue in comparison does 2d6 (7) added damage. 3 turns worth of this daggers stacking damage, every hit. 

my only concern with this, is it being in the hands of a fighter. even then, i'm not too sure how bad that will be. if there's no damage cap they can 5 average damage per turn (7.5 at 11) with one shot of doubling this with action surge. they're using a d4 weapon. no gwp, polearm expert, or sharpshooter. they're also sacrificing the +x to hit stated above, so realistically, they won't be gaining it this fast. their target will be dead before it gets crazy. 

let's assume they're fighting a dragon, and the fight is 5 rounds. fighter gets off 2 attacks per round with a 50% chance to hit. i know it'll be higher, around 70%, but for simplicity here they gain 2.5 dpr
round 1 1d4+4 = 6.5
round 2 2d4+4 = 9
round 3 3d4+4 = 11.5
round 4 4d4+4 = 14
round 5 5d4+4 16.5
total: 57.5

compared to a flamgetongue shortsword 
1d6+4 +2d6 = 14 damage
total over 5 rounds = 70

however, this is over the course of 6 hits - and assuming the player is missing 30% of their attempts that's about 8 attack rolls. so over the course of about 8 consecutive melee attacks on the same creature in a row the weapon is roughly as good as a standard rare magic weapon.

1073,n029eaf,RevenantBacon,"the +2 only adds a 10% chance to hit. how meaningful that is is entirely dependent on your base hit chance. if the target has such low ac that you're converting an 85% to a 95%, the dagger is better. otoh, if you're converting a 10% to a 20%, the +2 is better.

realistically though, thanks to bounded accuracy, the +2 should on average be converting a 50% to a 60%, because the average hit chance per level is supposed to be calculated to average at 60% chance for the players to hit (ie, game math assumes a starting stat bonus of +3 and that you take +2 to your attack stat at levels 4 and 8, and get +1/2/3 weapons at set levels).

so considering a conversion of 50% to 60% with all other stats being the same (level 11 fighter, 20 in attack stat, uses action surge for 6 swings), we're looking at the following:

stabby dagger: +9 to hit, 1d4+5 (avg. 7.5) damage
+2 dagger: +11 to hit, 1d4+7 (average 9.5) damage

now calculating the amount of bonus dice for round one on the stabby dagger is actually pretty easy. since we're expecting to only hit half our swings, we can very simply add +1d4 to the second hit and +2d4 to the third, and assume the other three swings miss. this gives us an easy 7.5->10->12.5 damage progression for an expected average of 30 damage for turn 1.

unfortunately, we have to do actual math for the +2 weapon, since we don't get to expect exactly half our swings to hit. 9.5 damage × 6 swings = 57 total damage. since we only expect to hit 60% of the time, that means we're expecting to do 34.2 average damage round 1 of combat.

so for round 1, +2 weapon wins out by slightly under one half of a hit.

for round 2, our math is thus:

for the stabby dagger, we expect to hit one and a half swings. in math terms, this is still pretty easy. essentially, either the first or second swing connect, then we add half a hit for the third swing. first hit is 4d4+5 damage, for an average of 15, and then we add 50% of the second hit which would be 5d4+5, avg. 17.5, half of which is 8.75 for a total expected damage of 23.75 damage on round 2 and a total of 53.75 damage for the combat so far.

for the +2 dagger, we expect essentially identical results to round 1, except halved because no more action surge. this means we can expect 17.1 damage this round, and a total cumulative average damage of 51.3 for the combat.

the stabby dagger has taken the lead by the end of round 2, and will now maintain that lead for the rest of the combat.

unless you're not action surging, in which case it takes up to turn 3.

or if you only get 1 extra attack, in which case it takes up to turn 5.

and if you only get one attack per turn, well, combats generally don't last 9+ rounds, so you're never outscaling the +2 dagger.

and of course, none of this takes in to account the fact that the +2 weapon could be any type of weapon, especially one with a larger damage die, which would push the scaling back even further for all users.

so in summary: the stabby dagger is only better if you're a level 11+ fighter who has, and is willing to use, action surge.

also, this doesn't take in to account advantage or disadvantage.",['weapons'],1llip58,I need someone to help do the math to prove how broken this Magical weapon is to my brother
1074,n03lwzy,ehaugw,"you missed the point. it’s crazy to assume everything hits *when you are comparing the hits to other features with different hit rates*. when comparing two effects with the same hit rate, like attacks with non-magical weapons, hit rates can be neglected because x*a > y*a implies x > y for any positive a. in this equation, a is the hit rate.

""she’s just come back from her first campaign. remember our first one. he chuckled. i remember you were so scared."" he said looking at one of the headstones. ""saying it was the end for all of us right outta the gate. but in the end, there were none that would charge into a fight before you. oh! and don't think i forgot."" arnfried pulled out a bindle from his pack and laid it out in front of the grave. mathilda looked over the contents, it seemed to be an assortment of fine cheeses. arnfried looked at her and then back to the cheese, ""oh the cheese is not for her, she actually hated cheese. the cheese is for the squirrels, and she loved squirrels."" mathilda could do naught but smile sheepishly. she had never seen her brother in this light. ""anyway. mathilda’s a natural. always said so. you guys know that. but everyone is saying so now."" mathilda looked at the ground. she felt a little confused by all the talking. she wanted to be respectful. but the awkwardness of her brother talking to old stone was not lost on her. ""she’s the best squire a knight could hope for. she’ll be a knight in no time.""

 

arnfried proceeded to slip in and out of conversation with his fallen comrades. mathilda listened patiently. she had never seen her brother in this light. all the talking made her feel as if there really was an audience. she felt their unshakable gaze from all sides. she was unsure whether she should console him or remain quiet or even join in the talking all together. but she did notice one thing. every time her brother spoke to his old friends, he appeared to be wholly enjoying himself. wholly sincere.

 

""it’s the olstadrs again. you know how it is. i think they're looking to make a move soon. you were always so paranoid about that"", he said to another tombstone. ""well, i think it’s finally happening. not to worry though. mathilda and i will send them back, tails between their legs, won’t we tildy!"" he said with a hearty laugh. she continued her strange smile. ""she’s a little shy, guys. you remember. ""she’s worried that if she opened her mouth, all her million thoughts would come tumbling out. aren’t you?” he said putting his knuckle to her forehead. ""ahh i'm just teasing though. but tildy does know a lot. you should see it. i don’t think any of you could keep up with her. she’s quite like carolin like that.""

 

arnfried stopped and turned to mathilda. 

""you remember carolin?""

""yes arnfried""

""the beautiful one""

""yes""

""yeah."" arnfried said dejectedly. ""i was just thinking about destiny. my friends here. they used to talk of it a lot. a knightly thing, i guess. strange how destiny works y'know. told it was our destiny to be together, but i think she really is destined for better things than erelein.""

""well, maybe destiny will allow for both to be true.""

""ahh yeah, you're probably right. destiny sure is powerful huh?"" he paused. ""but hey. i want you to have this."" arnfried slipped off a ring and handed it to mathilda.

""i can't take this"" she said.

""and i can't hold onto it forever.""

mathilda paused for a moment but understood the sincerity of the gesture. she closed her hand around the ring and hugged her brother. “thank you”

 

arnfried let out a cathartic sigh. ""alright. time to go."" he picked up urðr. “y’know, knights are buried with their weapons. but they won’t bury me with this. means too much to the nation.”

“don’t talk like that arnfried”

1077,n0srcer,DumbHumanDrawn,"the most common way to have instant death is by reducing hit point maximum to 0, which results in death (specified in every feature that does so in 2014, but streamlined in 2024 to a single mention in the player's handbook, page 28 under instant death).  stacking multiple monsters that can reduce hit point maximum makes for a truly scary fight unless you have ample access to spells such as aura of life and greater restoration or you have features like the necromancer's inured to undeath.

anyway, here are some monsters to add to the list.  i could easily have missed some.  also, keep in mind that any spellcaster capable of casting disintegrate or power word kill can also qualify, but i'm only including some that have those spells on their lists by default.  those spells and most of these features only cause instant death when reducing a creature to 0 hit points.

from the monster manual (2014):

* beholder - disintegration ray and death ray
* death tyrant - disintegration ray and death ray
* demilich - energy drain (if reducing hit point maximum to 0)

* vampire spawn - bite (if reducing hit point maximum to 0)
* will-o'-wisp - consume life (target must start at 0 hit points)
* wraith - life drain (if reducing hit point maximum to 0) plus create specter can be used on those killed.
* beholder zombie - disintegration ray

from the monster manual (2024, only new additions or differences from 2014 versions above):

* blob of annihilation - engulf
* colossus - divine beam
* gibbering mouther - bite
* mind flayer arcanist - arcane tentacles
* mummy/mummy lord - rotting fist
* peryton - talons

from volo's guide to monsters:

* alhoon - disintegrate
* catoblepas - death ray
* spawn of kyuss - burrowing worm
* swarm of rot grubs - bites (ending turn with 0 hit points by anything while infested with rot grubs results in death)

from mordenkainen's tome of foes:

* deathlock wight - life drain (if reducing hit point maximum to 0)
* bulezau - barbed tail (if reducing hit point maximum to 0)
* dybbuk - tendril (if reducing hit point maximum to 0)
* maurezhi - bite (reduces charisma by 1d4 and target dies is charisma is reduced to 0)
* nabassu - soul-stealing gaze (if reducing hit point maximum to 0)
* nagpa - disintegrate
* rutterkin - bite (if diseased/poisoned by this, a creature dies if it hits 0 hit points and becomes an abyssal wretch)
* sibriex - warp creature (failing six saves before making three successes or curing poisons means death by exhaustion... pretty unlikely)
* demogorgon - tentacle (if reducing hit point maximum to 0)

* death giant shrouded one - reaping scythe
* ettin ceremorph - extract brain
* fire hellion - soul taker
* spectral cloud - spectral touch (can work both if reducing hit points to 0 and if reducing hit point maximum to 0)

1079,n1581zz,abookfulblockhead,"as someone who came from pathfinder, maybe i’m just old and washed, but the granularity if the system kinda wore thin on me.

yeah, i could take a whole feat chain of “do the thing”, “improved do the thing” just because they’re prereqs for “atomic wedgie”, but at a certain point all those granular bonuses just kinda wash together in my brain.

and i literally have a phd in mathematics.

any feat that’s just “+x to specific thing” is boring to me. the stuff i really gravitate towards are flavourful abilities like the “beyond morality” wizard discovery, which let me shift my alignment one step in any direction for the purposes of spells and effects. not optimal, but fun and flavourful.

5e kinda cuts away all that dead weight, and stops the runaway scaling problem where the gulf between a strong save and a weak save, or a trained skill vs untrained skill is greater than 20, meaning that some characters auto succeed and some auto-fail.

5e also removes the need to finely balance magic items. i played through rise of the runelords, and when we got to book 4, we realized that even our fighter didn’t have high enough ac not to get auto-hit by stone giants we were up against. an audit of our characters showed we were all, like, 20,000 gp behind wealth per level, so the gm had to handwave dump extra gold into our pockets and give us an off-screen shopping montage to bring us up to the expected power level of the module.

3.5 and pathfinder are fine games… if everyone is keen on granular system mastery. it is not a good beer and pretzels roleplaying game, and it carries a lot of hidden assumptions.

like, every experienced 3.5/pathfinder player knows the big magic items are stat boosting belt/headband, cloak of resistance, ring of protection, and magic weapon/armour.

many of your magic item slots are committed to bog standard magic gear because encounters are balanced around them for progression. a cloak of elvenkind is cool, but is it worth a 10% hit to all your saving throw probabilities, especially late game where you need that bonus to even have a chance of succeeding vs finger of death or other save or die effects?

it makes a lot of magic items very boring and mundane. whereas a +1 sword in 5e is kind of a big deal. you don’t need that boost to have a chance of hitting ac 45. when you’re swinging for at most ac 23 or something, that +1 means you’re hitting everything more consistently.

you can give out fewer magic items, and those magic items tend to feel special. that +1 sword might last you the whole campaign. you’re not chucking it every 3 levels to get the newest model from bronzehammer industries, because for the most part you don’t buy them. you find them during your adventures, so there’s a story attached to them.",['spells'],1lqs07d,Observations of a 3.5 veteran regarding 5e

also, certain species still favour certain classes, but it's due to the mechanics of features rather than increases to stats. for example elf and tiefling both favour spellcasting classes because of how species spells can be recast using spell slots. while goliath and dragonborn both favour martial classes because of how their features work with attack rolls/extra attack.","['spells', 'feats']",1lqs07d,Observations of a 3.5 veteran regarding 5e

1086,n16fph0,eph3merous,"some notes: 

1. 5e24 has the ""racial bonuses"" moved to backgrounds. it's not like you don't get whatever bonus you want for your build.... it just opens up space for viable dwarf rogues, elf barbarians, etc. the game doesn't want a dwarf rogue to be a suboptimal build just because it's an uncommon fantasy idea. they want to play up the nurture ""i am trained in this thing, therefore i am good at it"" rather than the nature ""i am elf therefore must be sneaky.""

2. 3.5 has a massively different philosophy to classes.... in 5e you aren't trolling if you are level 20 without multiclassing, but you have to tweak and re-flavor things to make a particular fantasy work. subclasses are meant to capture the same idea as prestige classes.

3. game math is totally different too. you cited a dc 12 being low, but most characters will not have more than a +5 to their best save/check (unless rogue) in t1, and many will have less than that in in most of their saves/checks into t3 (in practice, they may have advantage from paladin auras or from magic items or whatever)

4. another one of these main differences.... feats are not really a core aspect of character growth. most of the time, you'd rather get a +2 asi than a half-feat in 5e, especially before you get 20 in your primary stat. they sectioned off some of them as ""only granted by a particular background,"" but...

5. backgrounds are stupid flexible in 2024 and easy to mix-match to fit a particular fantasy. as long as you swap like-for-like, it's not going to make any big difference. e.g. you already have all of the skill proficiencies from your class, but you want the ""alert"" origin feat, so you can take x skill instead

6. players often feel too strong as a dm because of the ""adventuring day.""  there are optional rules in the 2014 dmg that detail how you can tweak rest rules to fit your table. some players will push for resting at every opportunity, some don't.

7. dm support is indeed terrible.... which probably contributed to the boom of community content in 5e. for better or worse, the lack of support means that different dms have free reign to do things the way that best fits their table or their conception of the world, rather than e.g. ""this is what the book says should happen when a player wants to persuade an npc with level 3 renown.""","['class', 'feats']",1lqs07d,Observations of a 3.5 veteran regarding 5e

2. players do seem to have it easy. with all the various ways to gain advantage, acs for low level monsters seem more of a formality and saves are practically ""will they botch the roll"" more than anything else. i think the monster manual provides options that have some variety, but ymmv. can always just build npcs from the ground up, but that is a lot of work.

don't have your feat issue, you seem more feat focused than is necessary imo. but i've played a bunch of systems as well as dnd flavors, so feats aren't really ""integral"" to me. we actually started 5e after playing daggerheart for a time. i think dh is a system clearly made for theater kids. 5e seems a good bridge between that and the more ""number crunchy"" engineer targeted systems.",['feats'],1lqs07d,Observations of a 3.5 veteran regarding 5e
1091,n16rl71,ChrysalizedDreams,"one of my biggest gripes with 5e is that many classes are sort of locked into specific playstyles or have one playstyle that is so much superior than the rest that it feels bad to play any other way.

i've been a forever dm for... closing in on 12 years now. we started playing 3.5 because it's what we had access to. eventually we moved to pf1e, and we've been playing 5e for a couple years now.

bab is something i miss, honestly. or at least the way it scaled. you're right that spellcasters can multiclass all they want and still get some degree of spell progression, but martials are shafted because extra attack comes only from 5 levels in the same class, they don't stack with each other, and fighters are the only one to get more than two on the baseline. 

things like the rogue also apply. you could play a strength based rogue before. or multiclass a fighter with rogue to create a dirty fighter. it was fun to sneak attack someone with a greatsword. this is just an example, my point being that two characters of the same class in 5e will be pretty similar on a mechanical level most of the time, while in 3.x/pf1e you could easily take two characters of the same class and build them to have completely different playstyles.

i'm not bashing on 5e. it's a good system. this comes from a place of nostalgia/personal preference. i feel like a lot of the powerplayers and people who enjoy theorycrafting and making strong builds would enjoy pf1e or 3.5 more (or at least enough to stop talking smack about it) if they gave them a shot.

the one thing i'm pretty confident about saying and that might actually be a bash on 5e is the dm books. especially in 5.5e. a concerning amount of the game is left up to the dm to figure out or essentially make up. it's not a problem for people who prefer to run the game on vibes, but there's definitely a part of the player base that enjoys a mechanical challenge.

1093,n2oalsz,GoatEyEtaoG,"here's my take as someone who started off with 2nd edition, switched to 3rd when it came out, then 3.5, skipped 4, and started 5th when it came out. (i've played and dm'd all these editions.)

5th has a game play feel more like 2nd if you removed all the funky tables and streamlined it, but kept all the funky race variety and prestige classing of 3rd and 4th, while incorporating them into base mechanics vs. making them add-ons like 3rd did. 

if you're focus is number-crunching, wading through widgets and feats to find that one fantastic combo, and mechanical complexity in combat, you will miss playing 3rd. but if you're more free-form, spontaneous, and focused on story and rp, 5th frees you up to do that in a way 3rd didn't. i prefer 5th, though i do get occasional hankerings for 3rd. i definitely prefer dming 5th.

the rules of 3rd are far more concrete; there's a rule for everything. 5th depends a lot more on dm fiat. hence, for the game to run smoothly, it's more important your dm's not a power-tripping jerk and less important they be a walking encyclopedia of rules. it's harder (though not impossible) for players to find crazy combos to break the game, and it's easier for the dm to say ""no."" 


but since you don't have to be so on gaurd against problem players or builds, it's also a lot easier to say, ""yes,"" when a player wants to get creative and customize outside the rules. you also run into less scenarios where rules let you do things on a technicality when they really make no sense, or gameplay grinds to a stop while everyone's researching rules. all this, i very much appreciate as a gm. i'm not a jerk, so my players have freedom and fun, and i'm decent at spur-of-the-moment decision-making so gameplay is smooth. that said, if you're a player stuck with an antagonistic gm, there's no intricate rule system to back you up, so you'll probably have a worse experience than you would in 3rd. 

both 3rd and 5th have strengths and weaknesses, just, 3rd ed's a little more left-brained, 5th's a little more right. i think it's great both systems are an option.

to your specific points:

multiclassing/prestige classing is less necessary because it's already built into core classes. as you point out, there's more flexibility and crossover in what one can do. you can choose to be extremely specialized, but it's easy to branch out and customize, especially with backgrounds.


feats are far and few between, yes, but they are also way more poweful than 3rd ed feats and, individually, have more impact on game play. i highly recommend the race variant for humans that let's them start with a feat at 1st level. it makes playing a normal ol' human a very smart mechanical play. 


i disagree with you wholeheartedly on skills/proficiencies. although backgrounds allow players a wider selection of skills than they would have had in 3.5, the number of skills a character actually has is  small, which means characters tend to be very specialized, especially at higher levels. where as, in 3rd, there were so many skill points available, and so much multiclassing going on, you could have a smattering of everything if you were a smart human. also, with stats going into infinitum, you could hit most reasonable dc's if you had a few points and your base stat was high. also, rogue ""expertise"" gets crazy fast and pretty much blows everyone else out of the water when it comes to their chosen skills. a 1st level rogue and fighter might both have a shot at an easy lock, but by 4th level, the rogue will be breezing through locks that stump the fighter, and the gulf will grow as they level. sidenote: 5th ed skills feel very 2nd ed. 

disadvantage and advantage are impactful because stat bumps and bonuses are limited, which means your own bonus is smaller, which makes dice rolls more powerful. the only caveat to this is when your character is really good and the dc is low, but that makes sense for an expert to rarely fail easy tasks. what makes less sense is someone being epically expert at something but failing 5% of the time.


i agree with you on weapons. i miss 3rd's diversity of weaponry and crazy feats. in 5th, such flavor is left more to rp than mechanics. armor does still have a dex limit on it though, depending on the type and material.


players too strong/monsters too weak: i feel like this is culture shock. all numbers are lowered in 5th ed. and it doesn't translate mechanically to 3rd.  example: a 20th level fighter only has a +6 bonus to hit. stats cap out at 20/+5. so the strongest 20th level fighters have a 40% miss chance when attacking something with an ac of 20. a dude in normal full plate has an ac 18. 
granted, the fighter will probably have a magic weapon and feats that improve that percentage, but not nearly as many as in 3rd ed. these kinds of ratios play out with skill dc's and saves as well. and if you aren't proficient in something, your related stat bonus is all you'll ever add to a roll. a 20th level fig's reflex save is just his dex bonus, period, which makes a dc 12 a bit more daunting. look at the success/failure rate instead of the numbers. 


i find 5th ed monsters, in general, to be nastier than 3rd's. if you're playing at very low levels, 1-3rd, consider the training wheels are on. make sure you're making the most of the monsters' feats. if you want to make encounters more lethal, there are rules for massive damage you can implement. you should also look at fatigue rules. and i'd point out, you don't get all your hit dice back with just 1 eight hour rest, which has mechanical effects. i was skeptical of short rests at 1st, but they won me over. they cut down on 3rd's tendency to want to rest 8 hours after every hard fight, or before every hard fight, and encourage pressing on. specific class features often benefit from short rests, which add to that specialization feel you're missing from 3rd. also, who says pc's get those eight hours. 😈


also, don't be afraid to add some twists to monsters just to spice things up. i.e., maybe those hellhounds explode when they die. 
i feel like 5th ed makes this easier than 3rd, where i would have needed to level the monster and balance multiple rules. in 5th, i just describe the explosion in combat, and firebolt or fireball goes off. basically,  i just gave it a triggered spell. players get some extra xp for living through it. done. 


magic weapon prices are intentionally vague and i love it! again, this feels very 2nd edition, when walking into ye ol'magic shoppe with a shopping list was unheard of. magic items were rare and treasured, not a game mechanic to plan around. honestly, this is one of my favorite things about 5th edition. 


i 100% agree with you, though, that the 5th's core books are organized horribly. yes, 3rd was far superior on that. luckily, internet searches can bring rules up faster than i can find them by flipping through poorly organized pages, but i miss 3rd's tidiness.


anywho, i'd say, give 5th a real chance, let it have its own feel, and you might find you really love it. but if you really are all about mechanics, dungeon delving, and battles, with rp/storytelling being way down on your priorities list, pathfinder might be a better fit.

1094,n159qkb,thegooddoktorjones,"i thought similar things about feats, at first.  but now after years of dming 5e, i see just how powerful the feats are and how much they pack in.  they are character defining.  having 8 of them would just mean splitting them up to be less impactful, so you don't actually get more.  otherwise, you have 8 character defining different traits and are great at everything.  i do not miss having to take 5 two handed fighting feats to be good at two handed fighting, it felt like busy work.

i also don't recommend giving them away at 1 for free.  it just means your character peaks at level 1 then doesn't change much.  the stat vs. feat decision can be kinda hard, but also a wizard with 18 int instead of 20 is going to kill all the monsters just fine.

i fint that 5e is fine for fast, efficient rulings and for the ability to flavor your character in pretty much any way you want without sacrificing anything of importance in relation to power.


the bounded accuracy design makes it a better system for using all the monsters, even at higher levels, but it also makes the game less interesting at higher levels as your players do not really become extremely powerful, only unbalanced in relation to monster encounter design. 


there is absolutely no power game levels in 5e. this is because the design team believe that most fun is had, and most campaigns that are played, never reaches the very high levels. which is fine, but 3.5 could take you from pesant son to a god within the very same rules.


the lack of impactful options are perhaps what i miss most. battle is dumbed down, which means it takes less time, but the technical finesse is lost. placement, feats, magical items, support magic etc playes less of a role now than before. 


there's absolutely no substitute for power gamers in 5e, so if that's your thing, stay on 3.5.


in the beginning we really liked the streamlined rules, the ease of character creation without needing a spread sheet mechanic to have the correct path choices and the endless evaluation of skills, feats, placement and power optimization,  but after 6 years it's more boring than 3.5, as the rules just doesn't give players as many options and possible optimization paths like 3.5. for the rp part this probably doesn't come as a downside, but for the combat oriented campaigns it does. i know pathfinder is a more sanitized 3.5, but in there you also lack the raw amount of options that 3.5 has.",['feats'],1lqs07d,Observations of a 3.5 veteran regarding 5e
1096,n15ef74,JulyKimono,"i do think you shot yourselves in the foot for playing 2014 and not 2024 and not adding some of the popular homebrew options.

5e is made to be pretty straightforward and easy to learn. it gives a good base ruleset and sets it up for homebrewing. i see the raw experience as something made for new players, be it to dnd or just ttrpgs in general. but playing with a group that's familiar with ttrpgs, it can feel very lackluster if you don't homebrew.

multiple problems you guys had were at least partly fixed in the 2024 edition, especially if used alongside the 2014 resources. even more with just a couple popular homebrew additions, like talents that replace feats or the simple asi levels giving feat+asi. if you wanted more feats, there's the option to allow training for feats during downtime, although that requires the dm's approval and a lot of downtime.

the dm support is indeed very lackluster and it's been something we've complained, sadly to no avail, for years. a lot of the game is left up to the dm to homebrew and set up. which can suck for new dms.

the monsters are often pretty boring, i have to agree. making it hard to put together more interesting encounters. they have a good base line, but i tend to homebrew most stat blocks with something as a base. like giving an extra bonus action and reaction options, as well as a passive ability or an aura to a regular stat sheet.

it also sounds like you played exclusively using paperback. there are great resources and tools for 5e online for free that can help running the session, preparing things, and just in general looking things up. the base free rules are online too.

> we had to decide if mantain the 2014 version or try the 2024 one ... my players wanted the orignal one because of the lack of racial stats modifiers

5.5 still has racial modifiers, they're just not specific to the race. perhaps that's what you mean? this was actually a 5.0 change, it just happened somewhere between 5.0 and 5.5 and you wouldn't know if you haven't looked through the correct expansion book yet. anyway, it's definitely better this way because it gives you more freedom to craft characters as you please rather than feeling forced into specific races for specific classes because of the specific race-tied ability score bonuses each one gets.

> the first problem we encountered was: to custom lineage or to not custom lineage?

not the correct way to look at lineages. it's better to look at the pre-defined lineages as ""default"" or ""example"" lineages and all experienced players should really be doing custom lineages. think of it this way: if you're a new player, creating a whole background from scratch can feel overwhelming, so the pre-defined lineages give you a template to work from. if you know what kind of background you want just write it yourself.

> coming from 3.5 everybody was really surprised to not get a feat at lvl 1

the irony here is that they re-added this in 5.5, although your level 1 feat is restricted to a much smaller subset of all the feats (called ""origin feats"")

> feats: ... competing also for increasing your stats it's too much for us

honestly, i agree on this point. i dislike that they make you choose. my solution is to remove all the +1's from the half-feats (half feats are those that include a +1 asi) and instead grant a +1 asi every 4 *character* levels *in addition to* the normal feat progression (one every 4 *class* levels).

also related to feats, i agree with the decision to limit them based on *class* levels because it's a balancing factor to multiclassing. since a lot of class abilities are front-loaded to the first 3 levels you could accumulate too many abilities relative to single classers if you could also stack feats while multiclassing multiple times. perhaps this is a failure of the class design system or multiclassing rules, i don't have a view on this, but i get why they restricted feats in this way.

> [skills] one itsy-bitsy complain is that all classes seem to be able to do basically everything relatively well as there is less specialization

i can relate, but having played a bunch of characters now, it's really a good change. along with the racial stat bonus change it means you can make a wider variety of characters more easily. it just means when coordinating with party members during character creation you need to discuss skills specifically rather than being able to assume what people will be good at based on class alone.

> the advantage and disadvantage system is not really super impactful because if you are good at something (or bad) it usually doesn't change the outcome.

no disrespect intended, but i'm going to be blunt here: this is just flat out wrong and is a misunderstanding of the math involved. there are plenty of sites that can explain the numbers if you need clarification.

> a lot of flavour but not much substance ...

not much for me to comment on here except that the designers chose to leave a lot more up to dms on purpose. some think this is good, some dislike it. it's better for experienced dms but harder for new dms.

> disadvantage on stealth is meaningless because if you have low dex you are already bad at it

not true, although perhaps more table dependent than i think. group stealth checks are not uncommon in my experience and the difference between a mostly guaranteed low roll (i.e. with disadvantage) versus the chance for a medium or even high roll if i get lucky can completely change the group check result and change the nature of the associated encounter. about half of my characters with medium or heavy armor have taken care to find a way to remove the stealth disadvantage because it's legitimately useful to not be bad at it even if they're not great at it. then again, if you have a druid, just use pass without trace because it's too good not to use.

i've been saying for a long time that 5e classes are more like boxes you're supposed to fit a character concept into rather than tools to bring a character concept to life. in terms of customization, switching from 3e to 5e feels like switching from adobe creative suite to instagram. no skill points, no feats (unless you sacrifice other things, and even then you get far fewer), subclasses change far less than pf1 archetypes, no alternative class features, etc... just a filter to make your character sepia or have a big head or something.

adding prerequisites to multiclassing is an objectively anti-fun anti-roleplay mechanic. it adds rules to deliberately kneecap people trying to have fun and people trying to accurately express their character through mechanics. adding complexity to reduce depth is one of the first things someone in game design should learn not to do.

with how 5e is set up, you *need* to design your entire plan of who your character is going to be at lv1 in order to play them. you get so little wiggle room to alter them in any significant way that it's impossible to play out character growth organically. if my character meets a witch in the woods and takes an interest in potionmaking and herbal remedies, but i'm not profiecient in craft nor nature, i'm out of luck unless i wanna wait 1-4 levels to spend one of my precious few asis on a feat to become proficient in three skills. what's the third? i dunno, but i have to choose one because the game's mechanics are so clunky and cumbersome it's like trying to find a parking spot in a monster truck; this is not the kind of crunch i want.

1130,n16n4fk,mackdose,">the gm burden in pathfinder is based on figuring out numbers and bonuses.

no, the burden is in encounter and adventure prep, which is routinely an hours-long slog if you're running a party over 7th level.

*especially* if you have to modify any monster statblock, create a custom monster, or are using humanoid npcs as an enemy. all those numbers and bonuses, class levels, spells, hit die adjustment (which then increases size, better redo your numbers to take that into account lol) are why prep takes so long. then you have to decide if you're using magic items as loot or not, and take *those* numbers into account.

then there's the cvs receipt stat blocks. gotta know what all those feats do (and for published modules: did they even include the feat bonuses in the statblock?).

gotta know what those spells do...wait is that a spell-like ability or a spell? oh never mind, it's a supernatural ability. does the creature have enough skill points to have a synergy bonus? does this ability trigger aoos? and on, and on, and on.

re; legendary actions.  if you’ve got one boss monster against a party of 5 you *aren’t* on a level playing field.  your players get 5 actions, 5 bonus actions and 5 reactions between them.  your boss monster only gets 1 action, 1 bonus action and 1 reaction (outside of special circumstances).

legendary actions are there to bridge that gap in the action economy, and they also break up the turn order a little by allowing you to be dynamic with when the boss can act, even if it’s in a more limited capacity than a full turn.",['spells'],1lqs07d,Observations of a 3.5 veteran regarding 5e
1133,n164l1d,jtclayton612,"no problem we have a nice dm lol., a couple other things

multiclassing- spellcasters do get full spell slot progression so they’ll have a level 5 spell slot, but the spell lists are class based so they’ll have no spells of those levels, they could only upcast lower level spells. it is also easy to make something that doesn’t work at all in 5e if you don’t read the classes well. 

adv/disadv- this ties in to the skill checks as well, but as dcs get higher the specialized classes will start to shine much more. 10 and 15 are somewhat hard to hit without specialization, with a +0 in those skills you’ll only hit them 50% and 25% of the time, and once you get to 20-25-30 it starts to get much much harder or impossible to make the check. advantage/disadvantage because of bounded accuracy affects rolls quite a bit, think of it adding another +5 or -5 on avg which is not an inconsiderate amount.","['spells', 'class']",1lqs07d,Observations of a 3.5 veteran regarding 5e

eloquence bard is especially odd in that it breaks the math of social dcs in general (an entire pillar of trpg design, albeit a malnourished one in 5e), instead of say ranger that just bypasses the math of certain aspects of exploration with its features, or rogue’s reliable talent that tends to have more niche applications and is a bigger part of rogues overall “power budget” (so you’re sacrificing more for that power).

imo it’s actually indicative of multiple 5e design conceits by wotc:

- heavy reliance on streamlining/simplifying the game. (want to not worry about social checks? play this!)

- possibly misunderstanding their own game’s math. (thinking it would work the same as reliable talent or expertise, despite being on a class that already has expertise and full casting, which can also use it on things like dispel or counterspell checks, and it affecting an entire tier of play.)

- heavy reliance on the dm to regulate the mechanics wotc doesn’t bother balancing themselves, by using the parts of the rules they leave open to interpretation.

1140,n16m5yj,ShogunKing,"i mean, they easiest example is magic items. getting magic items and loot is a cornerstone of the game play in d&d, but 5e is extremely nebulous in the way it's handled. 

5e presents no real way for characters to gain this, or for dm's to give it out. they don't provide monetary values, other than a vague chart for how much items \*might\* cost given a rarity. they provide a rarity system, but the rarity system doesn't always account for actual in-game power. 

this isn't inherently bad, because the system could be designed where getting magic items is very powerful, and you're not going to \*just\* find them, you have to go into the world and get them from dungeons. which is fine, except that the power of magic items is often just numerical bonus to stats, which gives the indication that maybe the designers expected these to be necessary. which is probably true, because as you advance in levels, basically every monster you're going to fight has resistance to non-magical damage. which means that if you're a martial class, you \*need\* a magic weapon. 

which begs the question, if the game expects you to have a magic weapon in order to fight monsters with any efficacy, and fighting monsters is what the game is all about. why are the rules around getting said magic weapon not clearly stated. 

why do they have an entire section of the dmg about magic items, but then they don't make comprehensive rules about what magic items players are expected to have and how to get them.",['class'],1lqs07d,Observations of a 3.5 veteran regarding 5e
1141,n16vl3a,abookfulblockhead,"as a counterpoint, 3.5 had the same problem… but just looked like it gave guidance.

amongst experienced players, there was an understanding of what magic items you needed to stay competitive with encounter balance.

but the books never told you “we balanced this game around having a stat-boosting belt/headband, a magic weapon, a cloak of resistance, an amulet of natural armour and a ring of protection.” instead, those were just one of many options hidden amongst other much cooler-seeming magic items that didn’t actually feed into the game’s core balancing.

the thing about 5e is that it is sort of self-balancing. you are not expected to have any given magical item - your character will usually be up to snuff with a level-appropriate character.

magic items are just the sauce on top. a +3 sword is very good. it’s a 15% improvement in your chances to hit. but you’ll still be able to hit level appropriate enemies without it, and the game won’t collapse if you do give it to a player.

attunement also limits the number of super potent magic items players can use. so even if you do give out too much loot, they still have to pick and choose what to bring.

whereas 3.5/pathfinder had 13 slots for wondrous items (never mind wands, staves, weapons, armour and shields), and a good chunk of those were expected to be filled by specific equipment, but the books never told you that.

in 5e, if the group gets a magic item, they will hold onto it for probably the whole campaign, and probably get mileage out of it.

if 3e/pathfinder adventures, you would regularly kill rooms full of dudes armed with magic weapons and armour… and then you would sell it all. even if you did find a cool custom weapon you pried from the grips of the level 10 bbeg… chances are you would sell it because “that’s a longsword, so i wouldn’t get the benefit from the three feats i invested in warhammers”, or “sure, but i’m built out for crit fishing, so let’s sell it and get a +3 keen katana instead.”

even if they do keep it, they’ll probably hawk it in 3 or 4 levels when it’s time to upgrade.

and all that’s assuming the dm has been doing the math right and making sure you‘re roughly on progression pace. miss a few too many hidden stashes, have yo sell stuff to rez a dead teammate, and suddenly you’re behind pace.

5e… just give them some cool shit sometimes. that’s all there is to it. your game will hold up, unless you just rain +3 weapons and armour of invulnerability on them from first level.","['weapons', 'feats']",1lqs07d,Observations of a 3.5 veteran regarding 5e

1143,n3puaiu,KnaprigaKraakor,"the problem here is that the dm is the one who should be having this conversation with him, and giving a definitive yes/no ruling on whether a four-armed individual can make four unarmed attacks per round.  
for a character with two arms, unarmed combat ends with one attack per round, except in certain circumstances. monks' ""flurry of blows"", characters with the ""extra attack"" feature, and so on.  
with a four-armed dragonborn, to be honest, the idea of multiple attacks should have been thought of when he asked about the class. otherwise, what are those other two arms for, except roleplaying?  
personally, i would say that he gets one attack per round as normal, with a second attack as a ""free"" hit, but at only partial damage or with decently large to-hit modifiers. then his ""four arms, four attacks"" spiel is an extension of that same mechanic.

however, to be clear, this is the dms job to police. if your dm is inexperienced, suggest to them that they throw the question open to the rest of the table for a discussion. but the decision ultimately sits with the dm.",['class'],1m2hml6,I feel like an asshole for correcting another player

1145,n415zir,Due_Plane_9358,"my opinion is that if a game has rules, there's a reason. and you should toy with them if you know what you are doing and have a good grasp on the basics.
alfter all, will you modify a car engine without knowing how to not fuck it up? of course not.
you could try and understand what the dragonborn player wants, because from my experience (i've been a dm for 6 years) a lot of players are willing to read homebrew stuff but not the actual rules because it's faster, and sometimes supposed ""new"" or ""unofficial"" rules can already be found in the official manual (been there done that).
if that player just wants to make a ton of attacks in a single turn then the monk is a better choice then tha fighter.
also a quick tip unarmed attacks only deals 1 damage plus your stregth modifier, so even with 4 arms it will only do 1 to 6 damage depending on it's strength modifier.
if he wants to use the lower arms to attack the thri-kreen trait says that he can only use light weapons (you have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. the secondary arms can manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, pick up or set down a tiny object, or wield a weapon that has the light property) and even with that the attack number is limited.
the ""fighting with two weapon states that"" (when you take the attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. you don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.)

but in the end this will work only the dm cooperates, you should say to him that understanding and following the rules is helpful especially for him, because the dm is the one that must balance the game.

weird weapons tend to be weird because they were task specific. flails wrap around shields and parries, halebards can hook opponents or keep them at bay.

greatsword isnt optimal, no, but neither is any base weapon. magic weapons are optimal, if we’re being pedantic about it. optimally you can spam fireball 25 times a round and not run out of spell slots.

the post was focused on what the worst weapons in the game are. im just saying that since you didnt mention the greatsword, or weapons viable for gwm, that you were leaving them in with the options for ‘worst weapon’ which is just wrong.

for a side note, i do agree with you that polearms like the glaive my beloved are the best in the game. but discounting greatswords as merely ‘viable’ at best isnt cool man.

so again, a greatsword is more than viable, and if we’re talking optimal, then going for more damage will usualy kill something faster. which is optimal. please refrain from trying to justify calling gwm weapons merely ‘viable’ again.

1207,n4cqd1k,Sundaecide,"the solution here is find out what each player cares about, by talking to them, and then give them that.

* the cleric player may not care about their deity, but they might care about a specific cause or enemy type, give them a plot hook to follow that promises to fulfill that.
* warlocks don't need to have deeply woven stories with their patrons, allow them to have stakes related to the setting instead. it is a misconception that every warlock player needs a storyline involving their patron. some people just want the class-features without diving into the pact making side of it and that is 100% fine. in fact it gives you an opportunity to tell a more personalised story rather than an off-the-rack ""warlock patron is a big bad"" that will be found at 100s of tables.
* the fighter wants to fight and hit hard. you can get him involved in seeking legendary artifacts or being sought out by creatures/entities that sense his desire to become the strongest.

roleplay, at its heart, is making decisions with your characters motivation and goals in mind- if they are doing that at all then they are roleplaying. they do not need a funny voice, or to devise monologues about their reasoning for taking a course of action. some of my favourite players at my tables over the many years have been the sort to describe what they want to do or asy rather than act it out. the characters were interesting and the players were invested.

the reality is that you're all new to this and the players are learning both roleplaying and the rules of the game, those are skills that develop at different times. with you being a new dm as well shouldering an even bigger learning curve you just need to cut yourself and everyone else some slack and continue getting comfortable with the game.

before you punish them for missing hooks, you need to show them that hooks are worth taking. not everyone does well with the freedom a ttrgpg comes with, so having a bit more structure early on will help. fewer options, with obvious signposted consequences for success and failure can help as you introduce more choice as their confidence in taking control of the narrative increases.",['class'],1m5l4jp,I don’t want to punish players for not roleplaying – but I still want to give them story
1208,n4dgh89,Reason_Training,"some players are always going to get into the roleplaying part while others are more there for the action. as a dm i expect a mix of players so try to have a balance in my game of both. 

for your cleric and warlock maybe pull into their backgrounds a bit more into the story. if the cleric is not doing the minimum to honor their god/goddess then they will fall out of favor with that deity. the warlock made a bargain for their powers but if they are not holding up their end of the bargain then they lose their powers until they make amends with their patron. 

as far as the fighter goes let him meet something you can’t kill by hitting. an enemy that can’t be damaged by normal weapons with the cleric and warlock unable to preform their usual actions could be a call to action. yes they need better weapons but they also need to up their game. the most interesting weapons can’t be bought but are rewards for quests or for helping others. look at the old takes where the fairy godmother was a beggar in disguise and rewards those who help her while punishing those who go past her or even try to hurt her.",['weapons'],1m5l4jp,I don’t want to punish players for not roleplaying – but I still want to give them story
1209,n4cqzx4,EmptyPomegranete,"so, first of all, you don’t need them to have backstories to interweave into the plot. some people want simple characters. for that- i just suggest reminding them that if they want specific arcs or things from their backstory included to tell you and plan with you. if they don’t reach out- cool, that means you get to decide where the story goes for the most part.

as for the warlock and the cleric, they need to be more involved. cleric is eh. but warlock has to be interested in their pact and patron. that like how they maintain their magic. you need to get the details of the patron and pact. have their patron visit their dreams and encourage them to fulfill their pact. give them a mission. if they don’t engage with their patron or pact then by definition of the warlock class- they will lose their magic. which could be interesting for the story tbh. tie the clerics god into the story and have them send signs or clues pointing them the right direction. tug on the players curiosity so they want to engage.",['class'],1m5l4jp,I don’t want to punish players for not roleplaying – but I still want to give them story
1210,n4crz5o,FourCats44,"fighters fight. so that does sound like the best of the three.

it can definitely be frustrating when players don't want to rp, especially the magic classes. each class has its own benefits and drawbacks and a cleric who doesn't care about their god is basically a wizard at this point but with armour. 

mechanically it is within the realm that warlocks and clerics can lose their powers if their patrons/gods are not happy with them. also word could spread - the cleric is treated as a non believer and the townsfolk hate them. the patron for the warlock is revealed and the warlock is avoided as they are an agent of a devil. 

i am not condoning this but a lot of people use inspiration or level ups (if using milestone) as a way of rewarding rp - or withholding if players don't rp. can make things hostile though because you are making yourself the judge of what is or isn't good enough.

also talk to your players. as the dm there's a lot of prep that you do that players don't. it can be very deflating to have done the work only for sessions to feel like a drag. dnd is collaborative between the players and dm, not adversarial.",['class'],1m5l4jp,I don’t want to punish players for not roleplaying – but I still want to give them story
1211,n4femez,InsidiousDefeat,"sounds like you were thinking about holding the cleric and warlock's powers ransom. that is a one-way ticket to player frustration.

1st, at least warlocks are not required to have a relationship. the initial pact is the seed of the power and it requires no additional interaction. it even says the patron may be wholly unaware of the warlock's presence. leveling up is an abstraction of their ever increasing understanding of that initial seed. all of this to say that it is entirely ok for a warlock player to ignore their patron with 0 consequences on their growth. 

but 2nd, have you asked these players if their characters have greater goals? sometimes it is just ""be adventurers"" until something more organic comes up. my current character didn't have a goal until level 7 other than ""don't get caught by the guy he stole warlock powers from(accidentally)"". and now it is to try remove that guy by framing him or killing him. so that he doesn't have to worry about that.

and finally, characters are able to rp without having grand or even small goals. for instance, as a dm i wouldn't call a cleric ""spreading their faith"" a goal but just existing. but casting spells to smite evil and assist good is them channeling their deity, even if they don't explicitly proclaim their faith. npcs see the holy symbol and the miracles they are able to bestow.",['spells'],1m5l4jp,I don’t want to punish players for not roleplaying – but I still want to give them story

1230,n12kodj,AlasBabylon_,"so, this is kind of what someone said up above by rules potentially getting a little fouled up here.

this isn't a rule exclusive to twinned spells (in 2014, at least - the ruleset i believe you're following, i.e. not the revised rules?), but to bonus action spells. if at any point in your turn you are going to cast a spell as a bonus action, the only other spells you can cast on the same turn are cantrips that cost one action. 

i mention action surge because that's not a bonus action, but a bona-fide action that can be used to cast another spell if so desired. i'm also... *probably* going to be right in assuming that one of your veteran players is the sorcerer/fighter and multiclassed specifically in order to be able to do this. this certainly isn't impossible to circumvent (your other sorcerer, for one, needs to follow the rules) - action surge still requires a short rest to recharge, so spacing out encounters such that the group needs more than one encounter between short rests might help, but the other thing i would humbly suggest is to not consistently be making encounters that *fireball* can easily wreck. it's a powerful spell, almost inarguably overpowered, but it still has constraints (it sets the environment on fire if it could reasonably do so, it's not friendly, it's got a wide area) that a dm can exploit to curb its potential.",['spells'],1lqfn82,Help my players are too strong and i’m dumb

1232,mzpgjrl,CruelDestiny,"feat - war caster: ""you can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.""

yes in my opinion, technically you can utilize a shield as a spell casting focus for the purpose of not requiring material components. not particular difficult to engrave the symbol of one's faith (as a cleric) to a shield.

even if we're speaking wizards or sorcerer,  as long as they can give reason to their focus being part of the shield, with war caster is within raw.

if they don't have war caster, then they need to spend some sort of resource be it bonus or reaction to re-equip their weapon after casting. but that's my own ruling.
technically you can drop/stow weapon as a free action/ part of movement
 similarly you can pick up / re-equip the weapon as part of a move action (not in the same turn though)

so in this instance, if they cast a spell (virtually all spells need a somatic component) and don't inform that they requipped their weapon using something.. then they don't have a weapon equipped till their following turn.  this ultimately doesn't matter to much until they try to make a reaction attack after casting.","['spells', 'weapons']",1lk7myx,Casting spells with components and a shield as a spellcasting focus?
1233,mzpgzar,Yojo0o,"they may not cast non-material somatic spells with their hands full of a focus-shield and a mace, correct. 

however, stowing their mace doesn't take an action. everybody has one free object interaction per turn, the cleric can easily put their mace away and then cast cure wounds without wasting action economy. they can then draw their mace on their next turn if they wish. 

in practice, single-class characters virtually never have an issue with this. the rules will foul you up most commonly with reaction spells, and then only with characters with unique multiclass or feat-heavy builds. a wizard with shield proficiency holding that plus a staff, or a hexblade/paladin multiclass with a sword and shield, cannot cast reaction spells like shield or counterspell, because those non-material somatic spells require a free hand. they would need the war caster feat to bypass that restriction. can't stow a weapon if it's not your turn.","['spells', 'class']",1lk7myx,Casting spells with components and a shield as a spellcasting focus?

the intuitive way to describe and understand this rule is that you can't perform s components with a hand that is occupied unless you're using whatever you're holding to cast the spell.

for a spell with m+s you're using the shield to cast the spell (as a focus), so you can use that hand for the s component.

for a spell with s and no m the shield isn't being used to cast the spell any more than the mace or any other object would be, so you can't be holding it.

>does anyone ignore these rules and allow their casters to cast somatic spells with both hands occupied?

honestly for a large number of games you can straight up ignore needing to have a free hand for stuff and nothing is going to break unless a player intentionally tries to abuse it. 

especially because you can circumvent most of the difficulty by just dropping your weapon at the start of the turn (no action cost), casting, and then picking it back up (object interaction).",['spells'],1lk7myx,Casting spells with components and a shield as a spellcasting focus?
1236,mzuatoo,yaniism,"raw you are essentially correct.

if you cast a m+s spell while holding a focus, you can use the hand already holding the focus to perform the s gestures as well as replacing the m component (provided it isn't consumed and doesn't have a gold cost). if you cast a s only (ignoring verbal entirely because they don't interact with this at all) then you need to actually have ""a free hand"" that isn't holding the focus.

you can either put down an item as part of the item interaction on page 19 or as part of the attack action.

close. it doesn't cost an action to unequip the mace. it costs an object interaction to stow or drop a weapon, and you get one of those for free once per round on your turn.

war caster would allow them to satisfy somatic components with both hands full without a focus.

without the feat, the hand holding a focus is able to be used to make the required somatic components but only if it also has a material component. so if it’s only a v+s spell, they wouldn’t be able to cast it while using the shield and mace unless they sheathe the mace to cast. but they wouldn’t be able to draw the mace again until their next turn.","['spells', 'class']",1lk7myx,Casting spells with components and a shield as a spellcasting focus?

if the rule was actually a serious balancing mechanism, it wouldn't primarily affect niche specialist builds while leaving more powerful, more straightforward builds mostly untouched. it also wouldn't be easily negatable by taking a feat that is both already very powerful (advantage on concentration saves on its own is probably strong enough to justify a feat) and not very interesting; a serious balancing mechanism would encourage build diversity by taking different, more niche feats, rather than funneling everyone towards the boring raw power feat that everyone's already inclined to take.",['feats'],1lk7myx,Casting spells with components and a shield as a spellcasting focus?

phantom form: a bit redundant. you are getting one turn of invulnerability if they beat you in initiative and have no magic weapons and won't use spells. ranger will probably hunters mark you first turn. also artificer infusions almost guarantee he got magical weapons. unless you blink, run away behind something that grants total cover. this way the combat will take about forever. blur on self as a free action 2-3 times would be a bit more reliable and it needs concentration.

- 2) any cool non standard non obvious skill need to be shown, hinted or spoiled. aforementioned gem ""radiating an azure cold light sapping the warmth from your bone"" is such a description. 
- 3) plan for distractions. traps, minions ,moving walls etc. if heroes can focus down one target they will do it quickly, efficiently and boringly. 
- 4) i threw away recharge as a concept. one big attack per encounter to raise the stakes. let's be honest even normal dragon fire breathing three turns in a row (not that statistically improbable) is going to  kill everyone even if they made the save

1257,n25jkf2,Mik0s_art,"okey, to answer your questions:


1. yes you can. the fighting style just boosts your damage. without the fs, the damage of your light off-hand weapon is just the damage die (e.g., 1d6 for a scimitar). with the fs, you add your ability modifier (dex, or cha if it is your pact weapon, so 1d6+3 probably). good idea to have it, since it's the most reliable damage fighting styles can get you, i think.


2. bit of a grey area of the rules. the attack action usually is carried with your main hand, as you need a bonus action for two weapon fighting. however, as you say, nick says you do the attack as part of the attack action. honestly, i would allow it. numerically, it makes no difference to stating that your pact weapon is in your main hand if you hace the fighting style. if you decide to spend the bonus action for twf (for some reason), however, it is a different action so no extra attack. 


3. i'd say you can't make an off-hand attack with nick as the attack action and then make another one with the bonus action. the wording in nick specifically says you can only make one of those attacks per turn, and it is implied that it refers to the same attack from light.


also, unless you take the dual wielder feature, you can't use a rapier for two weapon fighting (as it is not light). if you want to use a rapier and something else, you would need the feature, and the rapier would need to be in your offhand, so you would not have nick and then you would need to spend the bonus action to attack.
main hand shadow blade + off hand pact weapon with nick is fine, no feature needed.


so, to make three attacks, you would need to take thirsting blade. two attacks with your pact weapon, one with the other. if i were making your character, i'd flavor it as the pact weapon being some kind of twin blades, so you make one attack with each instead of two with the same weapon, and you can roleplay it as having three weapons.


for the tail-wielding, i don't think there are any rules. i would allow another attack for a bonus action, with no ability modifier to the damage, even with the fighting style (it's two weapon fighting, not three) but maybe it is too much, as you would technically be capable to attack four times in your turn, combining it with the above so... ask your dm.


tl/dr: best option: shadow blade in main hand, pact weapon in the off hand. take the attack action, attack once with shadow blade, twice with the pact weapon, and don't use the bonus action for the attack. if you have the fighting style, add cha to both off-hand attacks. tail wielding needs dm intervention, flavor the second pact weapon attack if not approved.

secondly, if you want your players to enjoy an unfair fight you should ideally do two things: make them feel like they have a chance at winning (however small) possibly by way of manipulating the battlefield in their favor (let them knock over furniture onto enemies, break stalactites, push enemies off cliffs, etc.) and also give them a secondary non combat objective they know they *can* win (like saving allies, getting the macguffin, etc.) 

otherwise, if you put them up against an unfair fight with no hope they’re just going to be frustrated and feel like you’re punching down. ",['spells'],1lntglj,How do you make an unfair encounter not feel like a wash?
1267,n0lj2to,Novasoal,"not a dm, so don't take this as gosepl, but this is what i'd like to think would connect with me personally as a player-

\-overconfident bad guys killing their henches doesnt register as someone strong, just shorthand for ""this is a bad guy"". next time, send them in with a npc & have the bad guy hit his hench w/ a finger of death, transforming them into a zombie & having the zombie shamble over and hand whatever that henchmen's source of power (an enchanted gem etc) to bad guy. then, have the higher level npc go ""oh, that is a level 7 spell this person is way more powerful than we can handle"" (flavored to sound like someone in universe) & if that still fails to communicate to the party, have the npc abandon them & flee. communicate in universe that this is not a fight worth taking, rather than just having him kill someone (imo the more impactful part is the npc responding to the level of the spell, just fod & its zombification feels like decent flavor)

\-if the party insists on staying, have the villain ignore them for a moment, before having them take notice presuming them to have fled. if they insist, have him depower himself slightly- takes the head off his halberd (no idea if this is possible, not a weapons guy) & use it as a staff so he isn't just cleaving them in two, have him hurt players (chip damage) with non-damaging actions (on villain's turn he uses the end of his quarterstaff to shove the charging fighter & it deals some negligible damage in addition to normal stuff to communicate the distance in power), have him intentionally throw attacks (after shoving the fighter over, have him make a successful attack but describe it as him slamming his staff into the dirt next to the fighters' head, & communicate that the crater it left makes it obvious if that were to connect it would be lights out- and that the villain very obviously chose to miss, like he's playing with the fighter).

\-most importantly, if the party catches the message, respect it. describe him telling his coterie not to bother chasing, as its clear the party isn't and won't be worth the effort. can even have him dealing non-lethal damage to the party (since he took off the cutting edge of his weapon in this hypothetical- ik quarterstaves can easily be lethal, but not the intention of a tone setting fight like this) & describe them being too injured to continue fighting, describing armor being damaged as opposed to direct damage, and especially if you have a player who's willing to get fucked with, maybe have the villain break a weapon or two (strahd did this to my player once- to summarize i was using a pair of enchanted nunchuks to grapple him way earlier than we should have been fighting him, and after a turn or 2 of us beating on him the dm was clearly signaling this wasn't the plan for the fight so i dm'd him on discord to have him shatter the chains on the nunchaku to break out of the grapple & without anyone even having to communicate anything everyone immediately understood to flee instead of keeping the fight going).

  
most important thing is to understand that 5e encouranges people to get into an ""i'm going to (magically) hit this thing till it stops moving"" mindset, so if you are planning for a fight where that isn't the move, you need to signal that to the player & more than you think is necessary. you know what the scene looks like in your head bc you wrote the scene (or read it, if you're running a module)- the party needs to create the scene in the head, adjust it on the fly as you do your work, and plan what they will do to respond. tip them off, and then tip them off a few extra times",['weapons'],1lntglj,How do you make an unfair encounter not feel like a wash?
1268,n3gfii3,Nerd_Hut,"circlet of blasting (or similar) could be good. it's not a truly amazing option, but it does give you a fast option for a ranged attack without switching weapons when you need it.

mithral or adamantine versions of your armor also work. they're also uncommon, but fast from broken. mithral negates disadvantage on stealth from the armor, and adamamtine turns crits against you into normal hits.

1270,n1eyipj,Oshava,"so if i am reading this right, baseline (3rd level cause that is the level of the spell even if you can technically undercast it) you get 2 attacks at 3d4 with 44 health

also you have stat buffs but then detatch a lot of stuff from stats, like i am making a melee weapon attack with putrid, is it just +5 hit and 3d4 (for a level 3 slot) or does it actually track the things it normally and would care about its strenght and prof (so if i am following this right, +7 to hit and 3d4+3 for 2 hits)

an in general thing remember damage of say 4 skeletons combined is not the same as 1 creature that does the damage of 4 skeletons, this is part of the lesson people making monsters tend to learn because part of combat math is how many turns the things survive, so on turn 1 the damage is potentially comparable or actually ahead ( because of action economy power) but after round 1 2 skeletons are dead and the single creature is fine and now the single creature represents double the damage potential of the other two.

overall this just feels like you are going to end up with a superior single pet to basically any pet class and realistically be on par if not ahead of some full on characters which is sad cause i like the intent but right now it feels like this is going to over perform especially since there isnt really anything stopping this from still becoming several undead that were made with the power of being alone, 2 of these will nearly always be better than any 2 3rd level slots and output a significant threat at the base level 6 range",['class'],1ls06hb,Improved Animate Dead [OC]
1271,n1iuudu,Oshava,"ok lets look at fighting a fair number of bears at level 6 since we have been using those stats, we have 4 polar bears (the cr2 bear) for a pretty average fight, 12 skeletons and 4 montrosities taking reasonable turns

bears each kill 1 skeleton with an extra skeleton dying for every 2 polar bears that get ot attack.

skeletons kill 1 polar bear and mark a second for 24 the first round the number going down lower and only guaranteeing the kill as long as no more than 2 polar bears go before the final skeleton.

the monstrosities kill 1 polar bear and mark a second for 15 the first round with the bear dying no matter what even if all 4 bears go first. 

so best case for skeletons turn 1 is they lose 5 and worst case for the monstrosities they lose 1 

so round 2 the skeltons no longer can do enough damage to outright kill they might get one as long as they had some of their extra mark damage but in either case they still lose at least 3 and for the monstrosities they could lose 1 in the worst case and still take out a second bear. 

at end of round even assuming the best for skeltons and worst for monstrosities the skeletons are down to 4 of them only outputting 22 damage and the monstrosities are still at 2 outputing 30 the bears able to cut out nearly all the damage from the skeltons and not having the damage to kill off one of the two remaining monstrosities.

so it isnt a problem on the low end.

and that is the problem you are not slightly bumping it, you are giving them the power to take entire combats solo, if you want them to have a small number of companions or just one companion then build it similar to actual pet classes, follow that progression because that is already going to be more powerful than a pet class because you already are getting your regular abilities plus a spell that acts like a subclass.",['class'],1ls06hb,Improved Animate Dead [OC]
1272,n1kbw2k,Oshava,"i did it because you were saying sure at cr 10 it is bad but cr 2 it is diffferent. i didnt care about individual i did treat as combined the issue is their combined shrinks per individual lost and not taking that into account is blatently igonring a major factor. running even split initiative doesnt work here because you actually end up getting more below the bears with more units (you are more likely to have several 

but more importnatly i am not talking about them out classing a pet class i am talking about them being so close to a full character that it is a problem and that if you want to make a fair design that achieves your goals without making it broken and over powered you should model it as a pet class because it is at that point a full on pet class.

and to put this into perspective we have a level 5 basic build fighter, 2 attacks +7 to hit, 2d6+4(11), 54 health and ac 18 pretty basic build but isnt a bad average. they are now looking at 3 (yes 3 that is how the ar loop would work with this) creatures with a combined 132 health 6 attacks at 3d4(7.5) ac is 13 and hit is +5 and a wizard granted without level 3 slots which is fairly powerful, but does that even remotely sound balanced? even without the wizard the 3 monstrosities are ahead of the fighter almost for sure. that is a problem regardless of if the normal way is a problem or not, you shouldnt try to fix something by breaking it in another way.",['class'],1ls06hb,Improved Animate Dead [OC]

1287,n4xm52m,WoolBearTiger,"there is this concept called ""fail hard and fail fast"" and i believe you can use it in this situation as well.

my first character in pf1e was way overblown had a completely riddiculous backstory and was in the end.. nowhere what i wanted it to be..

however i learned a lot in several different ways what makes a good character. 

i learned to keep backstories to a minimum, because it just interferes with the actual gameplay and seriously.. noone gives a shit..

i learned not to focus too hard on one specific idea i have in mind and to keep the development of my character flexible in certain ways.

much more was learned by fking up the first few characters in all the ways you can fk up..

even my current characters have stuff i want to do better next time.

i dont think it matters really what kind of character a new player wants to play for the first time. if they want to go full abserd.. let them.. just try to give them a warning that the character will not end up as they are hoping it will. but other than that let them make the experience of what works for themselves.

playing a default priest with no creative input of the player will not make his future characters better in any way.. just because he knows the rules doesnt mean he understands what makes or breaks a good character.

this is also why i personally have a huge issue with dnd moving further and further away from the idea of multiclassing.

it makes characters stale and boring.. i could never play the same class twice in dnd because it would be the exact same character..

if someone who only played dnd moves to a more creative system like pathfinder or traveler or whatever.. they will not be able to create good characters.. to make a good character you first have to know how to fuck up creating a character..

dnd is like java.. it holds your hand and you basically cannot fail.. the character creator is already a railroaded system with safety wheels.. but if you switch from java to c you will scream like sirenhead because it makes you think the laws of physics suddenly dont apply anymore.. creating a character in pf1e after you only played dnd5e will end up in you creating an absolute mess of a character anyway.. so you might just as well go wild right off the bat and learn from the experience as mich as you can.

dms should be clear on this. which might not be as known to a newer dm. but the dm gets to decide what is, and isn't, appropriate for character creation in their campaign.

you can't take a completely new class unless all your current classes already have their subclasses.

so, if you start with rogue as your first class, you've committed to being a level 3 rogue and picking a subclass before you can be anything else. if you then take level 4 in fighter, you can only level in rogue or fighter after that, until fighter reaches 3 levels and picks a subclass. any dip is either turned into at least a 3 level arc, or is the last dip that character takes.

for a completely green and fresh dm advice probably won't be any good. but keep it in your back pocket for the future. when you have more experience and are comfortable with the ins and outs of the system. here goes, ahem hem. 

you don't have to have the characters sheets to run the gsme. ideally everyone would be on board with thr idea so it's fair and a practiced dm won't be thrown by clear number or ability fudging (there are edge cases. i demand a spell list period. even when playing this way. spells are too plentiful and wordy snd abusable to not have a vague idea of what a character can do)

in fact a game whete everyone (or even just 1 player if you have a stubborn git at your table) has concealed sheets can be a lot of fun. i ran a heist gsme like this once. and an amnesia driven ""souls like"" knock off greco-roman/egyptian kind of setting. if you are comfortable with it (i assume you're not. correct me if i misunderstood) and can work around the surprises it's weirdly fun having the party ""wizard"" turn out to be a particularly crafty rogue. tho again, i don't suggest this unless you are comfortable with it. 

now, with all that said. if this guy isn't trying to cheat by withholding his sheet, he definitely has a ""us/me v. them mentality""  which is never healthy at any table (unless your game is a competition i suppose? haven't seen it much)  so yes, definitely nip this in the bud asap. however there is more than one way to approach this. you could be a full authoritian git and go with ""what the dm says goes"" and just tell them no sheet, no play. csnt expect a new dm to be able to play guessing games when their job is balancing the material that goes into play to avoid a bad gsme (tpk, ret con. quantum ogres. the dm can cheat way more easily than the players)

or you could be more empathetic and explain to them just as i have. it's unreasonable for them to expect a fair or fun experience when you're piloting this ship partly blind (and regardless of how communal you think the gsme is, the dm is at the helm. period)

but at the end of the day i say you bring all this up with the entire group. tell them you're thoughts and if they agree, it'll be rhat much easier to enforce later. if they don't, work on a solution that ideally everyone can enjoy",['spells'],1ly02h2,Player doesnt want to give me his character sheet

not every dm will do this at the start, but a lot will, and again, it's entirely within the dm's right to do this at any time, to any player or to the entire party.

all of these help promote a sense of fairness, prevent suspicion from arising in situations where players just got lucky, and removes temptation in order to keep honest players honest

the only secrets players should ever have from the dm are the ones on their lips and in their heads.



just as  important, being able to inspect sheets means you can plan properly in your role of making it fun for the players, and helps you to keep an accurate party sheet,  which reminds you of their level, classes, armor class, passive perception and insight, and key abilities that you should give them the chance to use and take the spotlight with, without being blindsided by those abilities and having 12 hours of meticulous planning go up in smoke to one of your pcs bread and butter abilities in 10 seconds.

it also means that you can rework your adventures so that you aren't awkwardly gating parts of the story behind things the party can't do or is likely to fail at. this happens all the time with adventure modules, at points you're expected to have a rogue or and arcane caster and if you don't, there's no obvious way to proceed, or sometimes no way at all. to avoid this, you have to look at the options your party has, and make sure that they have a couple options for every important puzzle or encounter. occasionally, you might throw something at them to remind them where their skill gaps are,  or send them the long way around, but never anything that can completely turn the story into a dead end.

and a commonly overlooked one, taking a look at sheets gives you an opportunity to pass notes discreetly when returning the character sheet, instead of taking the player aside to give information.

hopefully this player just needs to be reminded that you as the dm are actually on their side, and that you just play the bad guys, not become them. the relationship between dm and players should be cooperative, not adversarial. 

if that doesn't bring them back to their senses, then take this as a sign that they don't belong at your table - at best they have the wrong attitude, and most likely they intend to break your game, whether through drama, cheese, outright cheating, or most likely, some combination of all three.",['class'],1ly02h2,Player doesnt want to give me his character sheet

absolutely, yes. but i mean doing it on your own, not just as part of the game—for now at least.

try building characters and leveling them up in every class. seriously. it’ll make you a stronger player and a better dm. you’ll develop a deep understanding of class features, spell progressions, multiclass synergy—stuff you really only internalize by building it yourself.

and here’s the bonus:
you’ll naturally build up a massive bank of characters—pcs, npcs, rivals, allies—that you can drop into your games anytime. some of them will surprise you. you’ll find ones you love enough to keep, evolve, or even make the stars of future campaigns.

1368,n4hxtz7,FractionofaFraction,"and this is the rub: i have never imagined any of the rangers i've played / created as having an animal companion. it's just not a defining feature of the class for me.

the pillars of a ranger for me are actually things that were poorly implemented, significantly scaled back or dropped in 2024.

1) rangers should be *the* hunters of dnd. they need class features - not spells - that give them a clear, scaling advantage against individual enemies. in my mind this takes the form of damage at tier 1, debuff (poison, slow, damage mitigation) at tier 2, buffs at tier 3 (advantage, overcoming resistances, seeing through invisibility) and take-downs at tier 4 (heavy damage buff, restrain/paralyse). essentially: screw favored enemy - everything is a potential target.

2) on a related note they should also excel at tracking. faster movement and expertise was retained from tasha's but not fully expanded upon. without stepping on rogues and monks, rangers should excel at moving quickly without restriction or notice, especially whilst following or running down an opponent. maybe as simple as implementing the 2014 blood hunter's ability to always know the direction of a marked enemy at low level and sync with debuffs at higher level.

3) being masters of their environment is my final pillar. unlike the restrictive favored terrain this would apply across all travel and dungeons. simply put: from tier 1 the party ignores difficult terrain when travelling (but not in combat) and are unable to be surprised / ambushed when not in dungeons. from tier 3 the ranger van use wis bonus / long rest ability to 'map' their near-environment (meaning any layer of a 'dungeon' they are in) in order to learn number and species of creatures contained within, also gaining immunity to surprise.

yes. i've overthought this.

no. i will be accepting neither comments nor criticism.","['spells', 'class']",1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work
1369,n4hninf,Ok_Fig3343,"in general, [classes are defined by the source of their extraordinary abilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/dnd/comments/1kvr15h/comment/muc7d4h/).

**fighters** accomplish extraordinary things by technical and tactical training, while **barbarians** accomplish (often the same!) extraordinary things by prodigious physique and sheer effort. **wizards** accomplish supernatural things by studying magic, while **sorcerers** accomplish (often the same!) supernatural things by being supernatural creatures. etc. its the *means*, not the *results*, that is key.

but **rangers** are exactly the opposite. they're defined by what they accomplish (being extraordinary explorers & hunters), but use every conceivable means to accomplish this: fighter-like technical and tactical training, rogue-like underhanded tactics, artificer-like extraordinary handicrafts, druid-like communion with nature, etc.

this is the *real* reason why rangers seem ""half-baked and unfocused"". everything the ranger does rightly belongs to another class! it simply does not need to exist, except as a mechanical shortcut to help players play popular archetypes like aragorn, drizzt, etc that would otherwise rely on multiclassing. 

>and then it hit me. the developers don't know how to make the ranger. the subclasses are the biggest example. some make you a hunter, others a retrain expert, others make you have an animal companion, they can't make up their mind. and neither can we. and so, when they tried to make the ranger, they made the cardinal mistake of trying to please everyone, and ended up appeasing no one.

well, think of the wizard subclasses (and the spell schools associated with them). the developers didn't ""make up their mind"" when they made them. they tried to please everyone! they thought of *almost every single thing that magic can conceivably do* and said ""sure, let the wizard have a subclass for it"". and yet they *successfully pleased almost everyone!*

the problem isn't ""trying to please everyone"" or ""failure to make up their mind"". the ranger's problem is that instead of being different *results* accomplished by the same *means* (like wizard subclasses are), each ranger subclass represents a different *means* used to accomplish the same *result*. whether you're a fighter-like hunter, a rogue-like gloomstalker, a beast master or whatever, the end result is ""i specialize in exploration and hunting"".

>personally, i would love to have the ranger have an animal companion as part of the base class. i understand that there would be a lot of people who would say that ""they don't want the companion"", and while that's completely fine, the ranger needs some sort of mechanical identity that makes it not only stand out, but gets people to play it the moment they look at the boosr. all the iconic fictional rangers have animal companions themselves after all. but in the end, ranger needs a mechanical and flavor identity that draws people into playing a ranger for the first time. but anything is better than a class who's basically in the middle of an identity crisis.

see, i would perosnally love if animal companions were tied into the animal handling skill, and supported by a couple feats. [like this.](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/sr3qhf_qt1ys) that way, every class could benefit from animal companions in a unique and thematically appropriate way, like fighters riding warhorses and siccing war dogs on their enemies, rogues using rats or ravens to scout on their behalf and deliver sneak attacks, barbarians literally raised by wolves and fighting alongside them, etc.

making animal companions into the ranger's defining feature doesn't really solve the ranger's problem, because you'll still end up with the ranger leaning on other class's themes (fighter-like rangers with warhorse or war dog companions, rogue-like rangers with small sneaky companions, barbarian-like rangers who imitate their own savage companions, druid-like rangers who commune with swarms of companions, etc). all it accomplishes is denying other classes what is rightfully within the scope of their themes.","['class', 'feats']",1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

by comparison, the paladin is the half-caster class which is strength focused, and the rogue is the non-caster class which is dexterity focused.

the non-caster, light armor, dexterity focused archetypes who we might at first think of as rangers, like drizzt or robin hood, should be rogue subclasses.   a lot of outdoor/animal ranger-ishstuff could easily be non-caster subclass abilities or skills--a ""rogue"" outdoor subclass might include a non-magical animal companion. (""rogue"" is probably too narrow a name for the class.)

a big challenge is that d&d class names have become sacred cows even though they may no longer be fully accurate descriptors, like ""ranger"". but they've changed before:--we used to have thieves and magic users but now we have rogues and wizards--so it's possible.  generally, we need to think more broadly about classes and then be willing to use subclasses as needed to create unique choices for players.",['class'],1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

i have been using the forgotten realms ua sub

new ranger is actually very workable, it's not the strongest thing in the game but a half caster never was going to be. the free hunters marks are free gas, your concentration spells are generally pretty sparse in terms of combat options from what i've seen so i never have felt a real opportunity cost in just throwing out a free cast during a random encounter and have that last me through the fight. the expertise rate has been enough for me to get that specialist flavor and be both mechanically and narratively honed. i think something that needs to be part of the core design of ranger subs though, atleast for me is some modifier or additional effect tied to hunters mark. it is part of the core class chassis, it is effectively a weird channel divinity or wildshape. i'm personally glad that a pet is not the assumed ranger addition if only because summon beast and or the one pet subclass lets you fufill that fantasy fairly reliably

when i first read the class i was a self described hater, it's now quite enjoyable and one of the subs i check first in the ua documents. i think they started with 0 idea what to do with ranger so the core subs are, an uneven level of done to put it nicely. is this repeating the same mistake? yeah but less bad as they seem to have course corrected already.","['spells', 'class']",1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

the rangers and the series itself is very magic light which i personally wouldn’t mind since ranger more or less functions without spell casting. most of the rangers i played just did attacks for their action and then some sort of subclass feature for their bonus with the occasional hunter mark if there was a boss or some aoe cc spell if that was needed. more often than not though the slots were unused or turned into utility, good berry, or absorb elements. it was nice to be able to have these when the opportunity came up, but none of the ranger specific spells particularly feel special and most of these could easily be changed to some kind of class feature. some kind of pool of features that you select one or two to acquire every few levels maybe? i always felt that rangers should be martial and that the spell casting was kinda out of place but there’s still the option of multiclassing into druid if you really want the spells and there’s plenty of overlap in the spell casting options between the two already.","['spells', 'class', 'feats']",1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

the 2020 one has to probably be the best one if your dm skips over the ""travel and wilderness survival"" parts of the game.

it also happens to be the only divine caster who doesn't get to alter their prepared spells each day.

my solution? give them the 2014 warlock casting rules (smaller prepared spells, but get them back on a rest of any kind. auto-upcast to highest spell-slot level), can change up their prepared spells on a long rest. remove survival proficiency fromm all other classes except the barbarian. remove handle animal and nature proficiency from all other classes except the druid.

hunters mark is as integral to the class as eldritch blast is iconic to the warlock, so it becomes a cantrip for them with concentration for hunters mark running off of wisdom instead of constitution.

alternatively, scrap the seperate class thing and just make ""nature"" a warlock patron (hey, if we can have ""celestial warlocks"", why can't we have ""nature warlocks""?)

from where i sit, they're really just a halfway between fighter and druid, with a bit of rogue mixed in. does hunter's mark hit the mark... no not really. is it a major feature... only during the low levels, and you eventually transition to real spellcasting. does the capstone feature suck... yes. does it matter... no.",['class'],1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

1396,n4l0apj,Apprehensive-East545,honestly they seem afraid to give the ranger the treatment paladin and warlock got. when people look at paladins and compare them to fighters or warlock and compare them to fighters they don’t feel weak or to similar. rangers need a smite/auras or invocation type signature thing. i think if they gave rangers the kind of level one options a warlock gets based on pact that keep providing benefits and roleplay through levels. they also need a big choice at level 3 or 4 and/or maybe repeating invocation like system. that also gives large benefits that’s not a subclass. natural explorer and favored enemy are very lackluster but they don’t have to be. natural explorer could be based on the terrain of their home and it could have benefits like patron for warlocks including new spell choices at various levels and/or unique abilities not tied to only working in that terrain. maybe some generic ones when you are in that terrain but like forest rangers should get several thematic spells at each casting tier not normally given to rangers and maybe a choice between features druid cantrips or an animal companion ideas like that. maybe have the favored enemy system work more like invocations where you pick a broad category of enemy and in addition to just generic bonuses there are features to pick from like giant hunters getting extra damage aiming at weak points on a all targets a 2 size category above them or they get good at reading large creature movements and reacting sooner maybe that grants a shield like reaction ac buff against larger creatures wisdom mod times per day. then either give them more feature choices as they level or give them more favored enemies that also would have new features. if designed carefully you would totally be able to have unique feature that separate you from fighters or paladins like instead of auras i have animal companion and i’m specialized against fighting large creature at range that can disrupt flying creatures with ranged attacks. then another ranger might have no animal companion dual wielding but specialized at killing swarms of medium or smaller creatures and maybe caster disruption when in meele with anything using non natural spell casting. they would have unique features where people would no longer view them as just inferior.,['spells'],1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

1402,n4r2a6a,DnDDead2Me,"hunters mark started in 4e as hunter's quarry, an alternative to the ranger's traditional weaponized racism.

for those who didn't live through the tolerant peace & love 70s, let me explain:  the original ranger hated giants and was good at killing them.  i don't know why the writer decided aragorn hated giants, but there you have it.  when the class became official in 1e ad&d mr. gygax expanded the ranger's lethal ire to the ""giant class"" which included all the traditional, problematic, humanoid monster races.

>giant class creatures are:  
bugbears, ettins, giants, gnolls, *goblins*, hobgoblins, *kobolds*, ogres, ogre magi, orcs, and trolls.

*incredulous emphasis added.*  
*(orcs,* at least, is consistent with aragorn fighting so many of then, and, i guess, tolkien also called them *goblins* in the hobbit, still doesn't explain the diminutive rat-dog-lizards making the list*)*

3e changed it to ""favored enemy"" which let the player choose the object of his ranger's genocidal tendencies. ""human"" was on the table.  

compared to that, the all-martial 4e ranger just sort of calling out or focusing on a single enemy as ""quarry,"" with no racism required seemed downright reasonable.  maybe, for the 4e ranger, it was something personal. (oh, and 4e orcs spoke ""giant"" - 4e had fewer languages, but it was a subtle callback, still sans  racism)

come 5e, and, of course, in the name of realism or something, the idea you could just focus on one enemy and do more damage just because was abandoned.  clearly, you need magic to do a little more damage to one particular enemy than another - this isn't anime!  besides, if 5e can make something a spell and save a few minutes of design effort, *it makes it a spell (we're looking at you, psionics).*",['class'],1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

it made most of those something that any can do with their spellcasting. wildshape gives you your shapechanging, but then all those other disparate aspects of druid, they made subclasses out of them, but they took those subclasses and made them all tie into wildshape. you want your druid to  not turn into an animal? pick almost any other subclass and you'll have something to use the stuff on that isn't turning into an animal.  
deciding that ranger is now a beastmaster, that all rangers are beastmasters of some sort (with subclasses giving more/different options of beast, perhaps getting your subclass at level 1 in a similar way to warlock) would help give it a clearer identity, but then all of these other ranger characters, especially ones that were explicitly rangers in past editions, no longer fit the class identity because the very identity of the class has changed. you could make a subclass dedicated to some sort of bodily enhancement rather than a beast companion (although that would require a serious class overhaul) to allow those rangers to still be a thing, though.

the ranger, from the start of d&d, has always been the ***tracker*** class, from an era where you would be expected to hunt down foes that ran away, or see a bounty listing and chase the bountyhead into the woods, or follow the tracks of a great beast in the mountains. and we see this when looking at the ad&d ranger class features.

their class features were (in order)

* an early form of favored enemy specifically targeting humanoid *giants* (which included goblins, gnolls, ogres, and kobolds) with static damage modifiers
* get surprise on enemies more often, and are surprised by enemies less often
* tracking better
* get druid spells

in 3e, the features were track (a bonus feat), combat style (twf), and favored enemy (still static damage). 3.5 added the animal companion, archery as a combat style, and ways to stalk foes better.

in 4e, the ranger's features were their fighting style (twf/archery), an ability that gave a non-scaling bonus on ranged attack rolls if the ranger was the closest ally to that enemy, and hunter's quarry, which ate a minor (bonus) action every turn and dealt bonus dynamic damage once per turn.

5e was where they lost the sauce. they all of a sudden became the explorer class. they should be specialists in hunting a particular foe and deleting them from existence. whereas the fighter has variety, and the paladin has the holy aspects, the ranger is the specialist hunter. that's what has always defined the ranger, and the failing of 5e is in being unable to deliver that message and fantasy to the playerbase.","['spells', 'class']",1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

1432,n4hhd2j,RHDM68,"i would argue, that based on the novels, drizzt is far less of a d&d ranger, and more of a dual-wielding battle master if anything, based on his extensive training with zaknefain and his training at the academy. he would certainly a few levels of ranger based on his days learning stealth and tracking skills during his underdark patrols, perhaps a level or two of barbarian from his time as the hunter, but those experiences may have been extra ranger levels perhaps. and, of course, much later in life, some levels of monk. but generally, for the most part, i see him more as a fighter than anything else. i never really saw anything of the ranger in him, based on the ranger class of ad&d on which he was originally based. and, let’s not forget, gwen is hardly a ranger animal companion, gwen is a figurine of wondrous power bonded with an animal spirit of some sort. 

the beastmaster style animal companion archetypes/sub classes entered the game after drizzt had been given the ranger label in the novels. rangers in the game at the time didn’t have animal companions.

aragorn is definitely more the stereotypical ranger that the class was originally built on in ad&d, and he didn’t have an animal companion. they were originally a type of fighter that was good at tracking and hunting monstrous humanoids. i don’t think aragorn and legolas are that different to each other. they are both warrior who are good at tracking and navigating the wilderness. one is simply more a melee ranger, the other more an archer ranger.

plus, second edition, or any other edition as far as i can recall doesn’t let a ranger go into “bloodlusts” like drizzit does. if he was an influence on how rangers were designed then they didn’t follow the script too closely.

in addition (sorry, i said i would die here) an elf in 2nd edition can’t dual class and can’t multi class a ranger. so the idea that drizzit was a ranger/other and just identified as a ranger is suspect. plus, barbarian isn’t in the phb, it’s in unearthed arcana and didn’t allow multi classing with rangers. i think salvatore just made up whatever the hell he wanted and got away with it because of the popularity of the books. if someone wanted to say that the salvatore-ranger influenced 5e rangers i would say sure. i’m sure it did. but, i would caveat that by saying 5e is more different from the salvatore-ranger than it is similar. which is why drizzit is a fighter/barbarian and not a ranger; the salvatore-ranger much more closely fits that mold than it does a standard ranger. 

or, to say it another way if you build a fighter/barbarian in any edition and give it a panther friend then you are leagues closer to drizzit than a ranger build in any edition.","['spells', 'class']",1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

1489,n4irv4s,19100690,"i do agree multiclassing in 5e is really good for ""dipping"" because some of the classes are insanely frontloaded. 5.5e missed the chance to fix a few of the worst examples. 

3.5e multiclassing is crazy, but it is probably my favorite version. it is complicated and you give up a lot to gain a lot and it is often a net loss. with the prestige classes and not so frontloaded base classes it at least avoids dipping for 1 or 2 abilities.


however, i would argue that 2e multiclassing was awesome. so much so that i have only ever seen a handful of single class characters in the 5 years i have been playing it. unless my family broke it with homebrew before i was born and told me it works this way. why be a 7th level magic user or an 8th level thief when you can just be a 7 thief/6 magic user for the same xp total? in 5e the choice is 7 of one or 3rogue/4wizard which means multiclassing outside of dipping is actually weaker.

dual classing was more like modern multiclassing, but with more restrictions. however the xp being class dependent not character dependent made dual classing ideal for any high level one shots. 

instead of 7thief/6 magic user with xp split 50/50  i can be a 3 cleric/4 fighter/5 thief/6 magic user for pretty much the same xp. which is even more bullshit than 5e i would say.

basically, in d&d 3.5, 5, and 5.5, everyone starts out relatively weak. there's an assumption that you're better than an average guard of a small town, and you certainly have a *lot* of potential as an adventurer, but there's a reason that the classic first adventure is clearing out a cave of wolves or a den of rats or a goblin hideout. you really, *really* start at the bottom, and the non-martial classes feel it badly (most monsters at this level can, and *will*, one-shot a wizard with low con).

on the other end, at level 20 players are basically demigods. magic classes are straight-up reality breakers at this level, while martial classes are on-par with hercules and other mythical fighters, including nigh-infinite strength, stamina, and durability. the spike in power level from 1 to 20 is exponential, and it's relatively clear that wizards themselves don't really know how to handle parties above level 12 or so (which is, super coincidentally i'm sure, where baldur's gate 3 ends). at some point, you can't just throw bigger stats at demigod-like reality-warping adventuring parties, and balance falls apart.

in d&d 4, wotc decided to try out a different approach. what if everyone started out relatively good? at level 1, wizards start with actual spells, rogues can turn invisible, and fighters can cleave enemies in front of them. just skip that painful phase at the beginning of everyone being kinda bad. the classic d&d background is starting as a mercenary in a tavern, or a local hero, or an orphan surviving on the streets as long as they can remember, or being raised by wolves. would *any* of those backgrounds actually have trouble killing rats in a basement? d&d 4 answers ""absolutely not,"" and lets classes start out at about the equivalent power level of other d&d edition's level 3 or 4.

not only that, but instead of spell slots (which, lets be honest here, are quite confusing), what if we changed the resource system altogether? no longer do we need synergy between long rest and short rest characters (if you've ever played a party with both, it's *painful*). instead, every ability gets a ""cooldown"" - you have ""at-will"" abilities (can be used every turn), ""encounter"" abilities (once per fight), and ""daily"" abilities (once per day). no more juggling 8 levels of spell slots anymore and all the confusion that entails, no more dm headaches as players try to shenanigan their way around spell slot limits (like the infamous coffeelock, a sorcerer/warlock multiclass that can get infinite spell slots as long as they never take a long rest). wizards can fireball once per day, sorcerers can mirror image once per encounter, fighters can cleave enemies in front of them every turn. this makes planning encounters as the dm *way* simpler, because you know *exactly* how many resources your party has. in current d&d, if someone has three level 3 spell slots, four lvl 2, and five lvl 1, they can cast anywhere from twelve magic missiles (seven of which are overlevelled) to three fireballs and any combination of level 2 and 1 spells they want. 

this system has the added bonus of making martial characters *way* more interesting. *every* character has these at-will/encounter/session abilities, not just spellcasters. in most d&d editions, fighters that aren't battlemasters are stuck rolling an attack twice per turn for most sessions, and even battlemasters have such limited resources that they mostly attack anyways. in d&d 4, martials have just as many options as spellcasters. i've already mentioned cleave as an at-will that they have, which just deals damage to two targets in front of you instead of one. that's awesome! it makes fighters wielding greatswords and greataxes feel like proper frontline threats! and they have *so many other options*. still at level 1, mind you, fighters have the option to take:

at will:

- resolute shield - attack, then gain damage reduction against the target you attacked equal to your con modifier. that's right, your shield is both a weapon *and* effective against a creature!

- tide of iron - attack, then push the enemy a square away and optionally take that space. live that fantasy of pushing back against impossible odds!

- footwork lure - attack, retreat, then pull the enemy into the square you left. if you're a more crafty fighter, you can now play that correctly and lure enemies into traps and chokepoints!

encounter:

- covering attack - attack (2x damage), then an adjacent ally can move two squares for free. this is wonderful for a tanky fighter trying to play with other melee characters, because they now get to retreat without taking an opportunity attack. synergy!

daily: 

- flanking assault - attack (dealing *3x* damage), then deal extra damage for each ally adjacent to the target. you can get bonuses for surrounding a target and playing up synergy with your allies!

- unstoppable advance - basically, you apply the tide of iron effect (push + advance) on *every* weapon hit you deal for the rest of combat. the power lives up to its name!

the list goes on and on, but i think i've made my point. the system is *extremely* interesting for martial characters in a way that hasn't been represented properly since (they regressed back to being ""hit twice a turn"" in d&d 5), and the system skips the really awkward early phases of d&d to get into the action quicker. you're already a proper hero (or villain or w/e, i don't judge xd ) at level 1, and by god do you feel it. 

the reason i say that it shouldn't have been called d&d is because, well, it doesn't feel like d&d. those awkward early levels are iconic, and spellcasting and spell slots being so confusing is part of the difficulty curve that many players enjoy. many players prefer d&d 3.5 (where spellcasting was at its most confusing, powerful, and exploitable), and when d&d 4 came out many players switched to pathfinder (a spiritual successor to 3.5). d&d 4e is a wonderful system that was unfortunately doomed from the start by the name on its cover. it fixes the problems with martials, it fixes the problems with spellcasters, it fixes the problems with early game encounters, and i haven't even mentioned all the fixes it makes to monster designs (like swarm/horde encounter mechanics that work extremely smoothly in a game where swarms have been historically horrible to handle). d&d 5e was an answer to the backlash and it reversed most of the decisions made for 4e, including the good ones, and 4e has been a black sheep ever since.",['spells'],1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

dual classing isn't worth doing unless you are starting at high hp or looking to suffer for a while. i know our group changed the xp rules for dc to make it easier and i did it raw once and it was very challenging. leveling up from 1 to 6 as wizard without access to my 5th level fighter abilities while the rest of the party was already something like 5/4, 4/4, 6 or 5 in various classes.",['class'],1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work

people's complaints with the system *are* valid. d&d is traditionally a resource-management game with a heavy focus on out-of-combat rolls and spells and (with dm permission) exploiting mechanics. 4e *isn't* that, and if it's what people came in expecting it's entirely reasonable that they felt bait-and-switched. it really should have been a specialized combat-focused spinoff that used the d&d branding rather than being a full 3.5 replacement.

also fair - i'm being a little dramatic for effect and making it clear where my personal biases are, but ""changed"" is almost certainly more accurate. just because i personally like the way 4e plays doesn't mean it's for everyone.

> would you happen to know the rules for travel in the 4th edition?

i do not. unfortunately, all of my 4e books (dmg, mm, and phb 1-3) are at my parents' place (like everyone else, i switched to 5e when it came out and i keep those books with me because the people around me prefer 5e to 4e, no matter how much i glaze 4e xd ). maybe i should change that and have both 4 and 5 with me, and run 4 for one-shots.",['spells'],1m66ib4,The developers don't know how to make the ranger work
1503,n4la60u,majorteragon,"we have a diffrence of opinion sir,

what i'm saying is that the themes that initially drove the ranger in older editions no longer exist. that style of play has nearly completely disappeared if dnd were a nature documentary we would have called the ranger class ""endangered"" by 4th edition and nearly completely extinct  by 5th edition. 

current 5th edition has 3 things that it pivots on during play...

1) roleplay or storytelling by both the playwrs and the dm
2) combat encounters
3) skill checks to move between the two.

to properly include rangers thematically into 5e play you have to dump both 1 and 2 to make room for the checks needed for an explorer or tracker to do their thing. 

the only way to keep the ranger alive and feel relevant would be to give it its own features that lean into options 1 or 2 and thus make it feel different than the others during play. 

this concept is evident especially in the oath of the ancients paladin. they even get hunters mark as part of their spell lists. this unfortunately means that another class/subclass has the same features. same goes for the fighter/druid combo.

the first one is almost always a more potent combatant while the second will lean more toward a “concept” the player has in mind. overall, not focusing in one class alone will prevent you from attaining those stronger abilities, which others at the table need to be “okay” with. 

my last campaign had two differing players who followed this trend. one played a monk who eventually became the best combatant in the party over time, while the other started out strong as a rogue, but noticeably dipped when she started taking ranger levels because her sneak attack dice stopped progressing. however, when she hit level 3 in ranger and got her second subclass she got a big boost in power which brought her closer to the rest of the party.

so all that to get portent and a stunted list of spells.

it's your character, you can do whatever you want. and i dunno what your table is like so maybe you can't fail? but you might be better off just choosing to ""pass"" your next few levels. at least then you won't be tempted to throw your turn away casting spells that won't work?

rogue is less self sabotage, but it's also partially redundant. you can already dash and disengage with your bonus action anyway. plus monk just... *gets* evasion by itself. any damage you gain via sneak attack needs to be weighed against damage you lose by using flurry of blows less because you have less ki. the nick mastery property *can* be ok on a monk if you're willing to make weapon attacks. scimitars count as monk weapons and you can then unarmed strike via kicks or headbutts or whatever.

of the ones you pitched; ranger is my ""favorite."" it gives the same weapon masteries as rogue so the dual scimitar trick is still in play, as well as a fighting style to further juice it up. hunters mark *might* be a great spell with monks high volume of attacks, but it also competes for your bonus action. the rest of the ranger spell list will be slightly better than the wizard list was, but you're still a monk so you still need to focus dex first. how good can your wisdom ever actually be? maybe you're leaning hard on the astral arms to attack with wisdom? but then that makes the benefits of weapon mastery moot, those scimitars are not your ghost arms? and it makes you even more reliant on ki points to ensure those ghost arms are always up.

and **all** that is ignoring a further point: what else are you gonna *lose* by **not** taking those 3 levels of monk? like ki points happen at every level but when would your movement speed scale up from unarmored movement? when will your martial arts die get bigger? when is your next subclass feature?","['spells', 'weapons']",1ltfsjn,[OC] [ART] Multiclass monk or straight monk??

imo 1-level fighter is optimum because for 1 level of monk you lose 1 ki and are 1 level behind on your martial die (and other progression). what 1 level in fighter gives you is the fighting style, martial weapon proficiencies(allows you to use dedicated weapon with a weapon that is neither heavy nor has the two-handed property: battleaxe/longsword/warhammer all are versatile and lack those properties, so you can get a d10 damage die for your attack/extra attack) and second wind(1d10+1 healing as a bonus action, compare to quickened healing: an action and 2 ki for martial arts die + proficiency healing)

i'm unsure of how many levels the campaign will run to, but since he has a gun that only shoots it's one shot a day right now (due to the magics of barovia) instead of its usual 6 or 8 shots, imma cast his wizard spells through that while he holds his artifact in the other hand. 

when i'm out of spells that's where the weapon mastery from fighter will come into play and use his daggers, spear and flurry of blows backing up by action surges. but his main class being monk. so like 10 monk, 2 fighter, 3 wizard for total lvl of 15 (if that's what lvl we are going too.) if it's higher just boost up monk more.

1527,n1v4wld,Buzz_words,"so for fighter, you know... same argument against as any other multiclass: what are you gonna miss out on. but you **do** get some cool stuff?

fighter would get you some weapon masteries. 3 compared to rogue or rangers 2 actually. (but you prolly only need so many given that monk wants to stay inside the box of ""monk weapons"" anyway.)

anything with nick buys you an extra attack every round. i used scimitar in my examples before because that's where my brain goes but on a monk specifically dagger is even better. your martial arts die will over-ride the weak dagger damage die, and then you can throw it if you need to? you'll still wanna be in melee for unarmed strikes but hey; never hurt to have a ranged option just in case?

then you still have 2 left over for ""whatever seems cool."" topple is pretty good and will use your dex for it's saving throw, but it will conflict with the nick idea (quarterstaffs are not light) and nick buying you a whole extra attack every turn is a lot of why this *might* be ""good""

fighter gets you any fighting style. i would take two weapon fighting but again i'm leaning on nick.

action surge is action surge: it's just good? you're already a short rest character so hopefully you'll be able to use it often over the course of a day? if you're **not** getting short rests reliably then this shifts the math. action surge gets worse and you need to worry more about the ki points you're losing.

then for subclasses i personally really like battlemaster. the maneuvers can use dex and at least some of them make no extra demands on your action economy (they just do stuff when you would be hitting anyway) of course others do want to spend your reaction or bonus action but that's gotta be up to you to evaluate how logjammed you feel in combat and whether or not you pick those. it's also worth mentioning that superiority dice are **also** a short rest resource so similar to action surge: are you getting those short rests?

if you don't like battlemaster: i personally think champion is over-rated... but it **is** just stock simple passive stuff. no additional resources to manage, just always on good shit.

kobo kanaeru was born and raised in a quiet village at the edge of a lush, ancient forest. while other children played in the fields, kobo found solace among trees and rivers. she spoke to birds, named the oldest trees, and felt the pulse of nature in every breeze. to her, the forest wasn't just a place, it was family.

one fateful morning, that peace was shattered. the skies felt strange, and the usual morning mist didn’t arrive. soon, smoke rose from the trees. a group of armed men had invaded the forest, cutting and burning everything in their path to make way for an illegal drug factory. kobo, only 16, stood against them, not with weapons, but with heart. she sabotaged their camps, disrupted machinery, and pleaded for the forest’s life. but her resistance was no match for their cruelty.

they caught her, beat her, and left her to die among the burning roots she had once called home.

as she lay broken and helpless, kobo whispered not a plea for herself, but a final wish to save her forest.

and the sky answered.

a great thundercloud gathered above, and a bolt of lightning struck her lifeless body. the men thought her dead, but moments later, kobo stood again. her eyes glowed with an unnatural light, her hair danced with unseen wind, and a strange staff formed in her hand, crowned with a living cloud spirit.

she called upon the storm, and the storm obeyed.

rain poured, lightning cracked, and the intruders fled, believing they had awakened an ancient forest spirit.

since that day, kobo bears the mark of a pact with **the tempest spirit**, a mysterious and ancient entity that granted her the power of storm and rain. whether this spirit chose her or was summoned by her desperation, kobo doesn’t fully know. but she accepts the gift, not to seek revenge, but to protect what is left.

now, she travels not only to guard the balance of nature but to remind the world:  
*""you can't silence the sky.""*

martials **do.** no magic only is limiting only to those who see sheets as your list of sanctioned actions, think a martial, say: champion fighter,  as a reverse bard: **overall high stats means generally good rolls even with bad proficiencies, similar but in contrast to joat.** by necessity they have to actually call actions, so play things to reward them for calling actions.

first things first, equipments: **a strenght martial is the party mule.** carrying capacity makes a hard martial more capable of just stowing answers in their backpack the same way a wizard prepares spells. rope, hooks, vials, crowbars, oils, explosives, the generic adventure fight man adores having tools and consumables.

second, falling with skillchecky stuff: **reward them with alternative skill checks through rp.** low mental scores doesn't mean they can't let their bodies do the talking - intimidating with strength (crushing or hurting to scare), performing with dexterity (feats of finesse), impressing with straight constitution checks (hazard eating feats), these sorts of lateral thinking.

thirds, at least for full brawler guys, **just tap their origins as a joker knowledge and/or homebrew a knowledge (martial) to be freely given.** the dnd problem of the martial with no mentals is just this assumption that everything must be mechanically represented so we end up with the stereotypical brute who knows how to fight but not about things related to fighting because there is no ""knowledge (fight)"" in their sheet. it is just sensible a  noble fighter knows tavern gossip about the royal guard, an outlander barbarian to know of his tribe's lore and his rivals' social structures, an urchin to have tidbits on the town patrol, so on, so forth.","['spells', 'feats']",1lnfble,To everyone that has played non-magic using classes (like Battle Master Fighters): What would you most want the DM to do to make the game fun for you (especially in a campaign with medium-low combat and lots of role play).

1562,n0hiesl,MightySultanAlt,"an answer most don't think about but i feel is really important - actually you often want to *reduce* the amount of checks your martials do. as an example:


so a thief is in peak physical condition, no magic but he has been climbing up buildings and breaking in through windows for decades. the party needs to get in through a window, silently take an object and get out.


a magic caster can using spells invalidate most of that without checks. spell to teleport in, silence, open locks, move objects, turn invisible. the problems in my experience often doesn't come from creative magic solutions - that takes resources, planning, making sure they have the right spells and the opportunity cost for not taking others. no the issue comes from the expectation that a rogue doing the same will roll half a dozen checks to do the same thing. a check to climb, check to pick the lock of the window, check to sneak, check to identify trap on locked container, check to disarm it, check to unlock container, check to sneak out. bonus perception checks for potential guards as the others is going on. if you are going to let a proficient spellcasters bypass a lot because the spell just successfully does it without a check - apply the same logic to your non-magical characters. have them just succeed at their specialities, thieves can just open basic locks with proper tools and your fighters with 20 strength in peak physical fitness can just force an old rickety shack door. the way many unfortunately run things is magic just works all the time but the strongest man in the entire land has that 1/20 chance of just having an off day with simple tasks.",['spells'],1lnfble,To everyone that has played non-magic using classes (like Battle Master Fighters): What would you most want the DM to do to make the game fun for you (especially in a campaign with medium-low combat and lots of role play).

1564,n0ewvjb,MCJSun,"a martial's ever present and predictable strength is their greatest boon in social situations.

because magic exists, people in high positions are usually on guard about magic charms and whatnot. being charismatic and being unable to use magic means that they can speak from an equal or vulnerable position that doesn't threaten rulers. the ruler doesn't have to worry about being brainwashed or charmed. if they're frightened, the guards know that it wasn't some cheap magic but the genuine imposing figure of the fighter. it also makes it harder for the casters to even use their spells in some cases.

martials can also handle more punishment and dish it out even without weapons. because of improvised weapons, they can turn any wooden chair into a club by smashing a leg off, or improvise a butter knife as a dagger. threatening them will not go well, so you have to be careful and respect their strength. mages and clerics can be tired out and then captured, even if you never land a blow. a trained knight or a crafty rogue can go on forever.

additionally, warriors and scouts can transfer their skills to a larger group of people. it's a lot harder to even find a group of mages. every town has a city guard. my ranger would offer to train every city guard that they came across. sometimes he was tested, sometimes his actions beforehand spoke for themselves. in either case, he would win over entire patrols, get the party leeway to be where they weren't supposed to be, and even use his pull to get audiences with people in charge or spar with royalty as a training exercise.

however this only works if you respect the martial classes as being way above the soldiers of a town. like strong enough to instantly enter a town and be in the running for captain of the guard or a royal knight. you shouldn't have too many people above them; if your players cause trouble then you'd have to overwhelm them with numbers.

you also have to make sure that even if there isn't any combat, days themselves are still full. if you leave things to one event per day, then you'll end up with the same issue as one fight per day. have the party do investigations, public meetings, or even a show.

throw everyone out of their comfort zone. the fighter/rogue is the gallant one, so they have to perform as the hero in a traditional show. nobody cares that the bard has the charisma for it, they need the body type and athleticism. with both that, and with negotiations, open up other skills too, though this works for all non-charisma classes. history proficiency can be used to know the proper traditions. insight can catch and expose liars. athletics can win over a group that you helped carry things for, or unlock new doors literally and figuratively. if you already find the info, no need for charisma.

1577,n0fudj8,OceussRuler,"but i am comparing a level 20 sneak against a level 5 fireball, to show the difference of potential. a rogue can crit, true. they can also miss, and they have one attack, so they basically do nothing this turn, and they can also attack sometimes without sneak, which means they do... average of 10 damages (rapier + 5 dex). this is the issue with the rogue in my book, damages are contextual, you have more conditions to use them than martials or spellcasters, this is the only thing a rogue can do in combat, but even then it's kind of meh, outside of 1 attack over 20. it's kind of the same issue that the champion or barbarian face with critical ability.

i don't know if you have played a rogue but when you are unlucky with multiple turns in a row where you either roll low and miss attacks or you can't get a sneak attack, damn that is frustrating cause there's nothing you can do. at least with multiple attacks you generally can land a hit or with spells, even if the monsters pass the dc, there is often a side effect. but dealing 7 damages or missing completely, ugh.

bardic inspiration means the bards can turn other people into skill monkeys for one check, this is why this feature is extremely strong. need an investigation check but you have a wizard and the dc is high? take that bardic inspiration gandalf, which means you can do it quite easily. i believe that counts. hell, the bard can make the rogue better at his job if you have the two.

other than that, there is more advantages to the bard. both get three skills at creation, but to be fair, the rogue get the thieves tools which is something clearly more usefull than three instruments outside of very very specific circumstances.   
  
rogue are excellent at dex check and bard at cha, but dex is a stat everyone wants while cha is a usually a dump one, so in general, you will always find someone able to take care of dex shenanigans (and bards do well), while for cha, it will depends if you party count a sorcerer, a warlock or a paladin. also, you can generally try multiple time dex skills (multiple characters can attempt to pick a lock, or instead use brute force if it fails), while face checks are generally more win or lose situations. but i agree it will depends heavily on the game and the players, but i think it still stands as a general observation that the charisma checks have less opportunities than the dex ones.",['spells'],1lnfble,To everyone that has played non-magic using classes (like Battle Master Fighters): What would you most want the DM to do to make the game fun for you (especially in a campaign with medium-low combat and lots of role play).

1579,n0fufec,OceussRuler,"also, the core niche of the rogue, thieves tools and stealth, can both be done by spells (and the bards learn the two most obvious replacement, knock and invisibility, and they will prove stronger over time in the sense that the first is ""it works"" without conditions, and the second hide you in plain sight, or some more specific spells that can be handy during infiltration such as options for teleportation, crowd control etc.). meanwhile being the face leader is something the rogue has to invest, and means he is losing on core attributes in order to do so, a core attributes that just contributes to be a skill monkey.

i recognize that reliable talent is one hell of an ability, and will give the rogue a niche, being that he will probably never fails at its thieves tools/dex checks in general past that point and can do it all the day.  but jack of all trades is as strong with the flexibility it gives to the bard (and also makes him better in combat considering it applies to initiative checks too). 

this is where my issue with the rogues is. i see what was attempted with him, in battle, being able to do high damages in one attack with some conditions to not be better than barbarians/rangers/fighter in general, but this ability lacks flexibility in the end for damages not that impressive outside specifically during a critical strike. and in skills, having a lot of them and no limits on the day about what he can do, but we clearly are falling in one of the issues with dnd5 being that it's quite rare to run so much encounter per day that ressources are that much of an issue and then that the rogue unlimited abilities are that usefull. the overall balance of stats, dex being in between extremely important and good for everyone, while charisma is between main stats to dump stats, also doesn't not help the rogue because his roll can be taken by someone else. while bard is the jack of all trades and the rogue the specialist on paper, the former still get expertise to be a specialist too and spells to temporary be one in other area, while the rogue don't get anything in the jack of all trades department.

i should also mention that the artificier, a class i see as the third skill monkey of the game, can heavily walk on the rogue terrain too, especially if you play the armorer (infiltration armor + access to thieves tools and tools expertise + flash of genius, + being able to make magic items that can trivialize some skill challenges + spells, and you will be a skill gorilla).

when we consider this whole topic is about how martials are lacking in fun compared to caster, i believe spells are a valid point when we are comparing how good they are at being skill monkey. in my case, i've run many games without a skill monkey character, and honestly, it never feel it was much of an issue once the casters starts to have a wide range of options.

although for the first three-four levels, the rogue is great and probably better than the bard or the artificer. sneak attacks strikes hard until multiple attacks and 3rd levels spells at level 5, and the other classes, especially casters, don't have the strong ability and spells than can replace the huge amount of skill expertise the rogue have.","['spells', 'class']",1lnfble,To everyone that has played non-magic using classes (like Battle Master Fighters): What would you most want the DM to do to make the game fun for you (especially in a campaign with medium-low combat and lots of role play).

\>i don't know if you have played a rogue but when you are unlucky with multiple turns in a row where you either roll low and miss attacks or you can't get a sneak attack, damn that is frustrating cause there's nothing you can do.

i don't see why it is any different than the caster using their save or suck spell and the enemy saving so it does nothing, or getting unlucky and rolling shit for damage on fireball and doing like 10. 

i'm not making the argument that rogue is better than bard across the board. they are a full caster which makes them above by default. i don't think saying spells can just replace thieves tools is quite right. you can't knock a trap for example. you can for a lock, provided you don't care about making a shit ton of noise and are okay burning slots, as well as taking that instead of another spell. invisibility is nice, but it doesn't actually mean you aren't detected. you still make noise, so if you can't roll well on stealth then it isn't just a handwave replacement. i guess if your dm treats it like bg3 or something then sure, but at that point we are houseruling.

bardic inspiration is also variable. getting a 1 isn't doing much. rolling max is doing a lot. and again a limited pool.

if we are talking skills, having a +2 dex or whatever on some other class without the proficiency/expertise isn't really a replacement. it's better than nothing, but just handwaving it like that is a bit unfair. by that logic, the rogue can just take proficiency in persuasion and be the face so no need for a cha character.

honestly, i think i gotta mirror you man. changeling would be one of, if not the single best racial ability to have in real life, much more valuable just picking up a random skill as a variant human, for instance. 

wizards can always learn new magics, so that's a good pick too, but you gotta indeed throw some druid in there indeed. although, there's not too many animals on earth that i'd want to change into that would be considered high cr, i don't think. anything above wolf cr is just likely to get you hunter. cats and birds is where its at. so i'll just take 8 levels of druid for the flying speed wildshapes, and pick whatever subclass gives me the most every day use. gotta be shepard. talk to all animals is already enough of a boon for me not to really care even about wildshape if that was the only thing out of all d&d i could get. 

wizard subclass, probably diviner. portent would be one hell of a skill to know irl. i don't need too many levels in wizard though, since most of the utility spells are low level anyway, so 2 levels should do fine. i get slots for upcasting some stuff if needed from being a druid.

i'll fill out the rest with 10 levels of monk for purity of body, letting me ignore all diseases and poisons, mostly so i just never have to worry about diarree from kfc ever again. but also because it'll make me buff but still nimble, and keys into wisdom from the druid (i already do most of my things by intuition anyway). subclass? probably mercy or something. i'd say long death for almost immortality, but i'd only be able reach 11th level by sacrificing either my ability to turn into birds, or to foresee the future. and i don't plan on being in situations that would reduced me to zero hp so often that a simple casting of shield wouldn't also safe me",['spells'],1lp15w1,What race and class would you want to be?

1610,n0u7sd6,TheThoughtmaker,"i once optimized a character build not for power, but for fun. i crammed as much of it into her as i could, from the blow-by-blow action to how she spends her downtime, from her abilities to her equipment. i even made sure that it wasn't something that comes online at a certain level; every level from 1 to 10 has a cool new tool that signficantly impacts her playstyle.

liz is the person i want to be, not in an aspirational ""i wish i were more like this"" way, but a ""this is my true self that's suppressed by circumstance"" way. a concrete example: i don't go skydiving not because i'm afraid, but because i'm poor. i'm an adrenaline junkie living the slow life, a runner who wore out my knees before i even finished high school. literally walked 15 miles one night because i felt like wandering, because i'm an adventurer irl with nothing but my feet to let me live that. given the opportunity, such as by having magical powers in a medieval fantasy realm, i would be a lot more like myself. that's what i want, that's who the character is.

i was designing for a particular 3.75e gestalt table that used [teitr](https://michaeliantorno.com/feat-taxes-in-pathfinder/) and a few other qol adjustments (immediate actions don't cost your swift, which was something dnd had already implemented), and i wouldn't have her any other way. liz is a deepwyrm darkborn (half-drow) with a **ton** of abilities from multiclassing, so here's some broad strokes from the lv10 build:

* maneuvers: known 27 (up to 5th-level), readied 17, stances 7, recovery methods 5 (including a 1/round free action and an immediate action, so maneuvers are pretty darn spammable).
* spells: can prepare anything 4th-level or lower from any class. 2nd-level animate dead, 3rd-level wall of stone, etc.
* weapons: can draw/shealth weapons as free actions, including hidden weapons. endless duplication of both ammo and thrown weapons. primarily uses broadblade longswords and a bone bow.
* crafty: one per day, liz can gain a feat for a day; item creation feats are a fun option. she also has a spontaneous spell to boost her own knowledge checks, which is another way to turn temporary abilities into permanent benefits.
* high-octane berserker: liz can go from 0-60 pretty darn quick. she can't be flat-footed and has a load of boosts and steroids; she can activate ferocity, haste, *and* rage in the same turn, then move and standard. full-attacks consist of \~27 rolls, so never end your turn near her.
* plays with her food: debuffs out the wazoo. even at range, she can apply ability damage, blind, demoralize, pinned, and prone. in melee, add dispel magic and negative levels to the list of spammable debuffs.
* slippery: several flavors of immediate-action ""you miss, no roll needed"" combined with ""whenever you miss me, i get to move 10ft"". she can turn invisible just by passing a stealth check.
* squad leader: aoe teams buffs, including attack, damage, ac, healing, and temporary hp.","['spells', 'weapons', 'class', 'feats']",1lp15w1,What race and class would you want to be?

for a great sword wielding fighter with a 17 str it’s absolutely better to take gwm.

the extra +1 to con and 8 extra hp by level 8 will easily be outclassed by the damage negation from heavy armour master and defense of mage slayer. not to mention the ability to trigger concentration checks at disadvantage with graze every single attack.

the reality is that the first one alone was enough. a monk *before* xge and tce was better off ignoring most of their class features in order to take crossbow expert / sharpshooter and play like a ranged rogue. after xge you had a subclass that could do that without ignoring most of the class features. after tce all monks didn't need to ignore their class features to do this, while mercy was much stronger than every other monk while playing nothing like any other monk.

• i keep the campaign timekeeping rules from d&d vol 3 and the 1e dmg, because those are really important to a well-run and balanced campaign. in fact, i'd go so far as to say that it's the single most important rule in all of d&d. gygax was not kidding when he wrote that ""you can not have a meaningful campaign if strict time records are not kept.""

1657,n5601c1,ancientstephanie,"several things from 3.x for me:

* clear magic item creation rules
* abundant feats
* prestige classes
* epic levels and divine ranks

**magic item creation**  
the 3.5e books were extremely clear about what spells were involved in the creation of a magic item, what aura(s) could be detected on that item through detect magic, what level of caster was needed to create the item, the specific feats (magic item creation required having specific feats in 3.x), how long it would take to create the item, and what the material and xp costs would be, all alongside the finished costs.

this was extremely useful to both players and dms, as you knew the how and why of magical items and could easily determine the requirements for crafting them - which were often quite steep, so steep in fact that higher level magic items could easily become the life's work of a particular wizard, with their entire build focused on meeting the requirements.

**feats**

if i recall correctly, ability score increases were every 4th level,  feats were every 3rd level, and some classes got bonus feats at other times from a curated subset of available feats beneficial to their class. they were every bit as important to granular character customization as skill points were.  
  
we got them more often, didn't have to choose between an asi and a feat, and used them as integral parts of some class progression, notably that of fighters and wizards.

for example, fighters got bonus feats at 1st, 2nd level, and every even level thereafter, which shaped their class dramatically. these feats weren't exclusive to fighters, but fighters got to take them much more often than other classes would gain access to them, giving 3.5 fighters their identity of picking up particular specialized techniques and being really good at the, instead of needing to pick a subclass.  these included bread and butter fighter abilities like ""improved critical"" and ""two-weapon fighting"" that we now know as class features. 

feats often had prerequisites, which could include other feats, and several feats used this for progression, for example, power attack -> cleave -> great cleave. 

**prestige classes**

several of the subclasses we know and love in 5e were based on 3.5's prestige classes, such as the arcane trickster and eldritch knight, but prestige classes were much more than our modern day subclasses. they had complex requirements that were almost a puzzle in and of themselves, as you typically had to have some combination of specific skills, spells, feats, class abilities, and ability scores to qualify for the prestige class, which would either be a capstone to one of the core classes, like the archmage class, or would require you to find which combination of multiclassing would allow you to qualify. it was something of a character optimization game just to figure out the quickest paths into desired prestige classes. 

for example, arcane tricksters needed to be able to cast mage hand plus a 3rd level spell, have sufficient ranks in skills such as disable device and knowledge (arcana), have an alignment that wasn't lawful, and be able to sneak attack with at least 2d6 of bonus damage, before they could ever take their first level in arcane trickster.

and it gets crazier... assassins had to be evil, had to have certain skills, and they had to kill a humanoid in cold blood specifically for the purpose of becoming an assassin, before they'd be able to take their first level in the class. 

**epic levels and divine ranks**

these didn't necessarily come into play much, and quite frankly, could be beyond broken, but that was the point, we had rules for things beyond the power of most mere mortals, including the heroes of legend and the very gods of the multiverse.

most players would never get here, but the existence of defined, systematic rules for what was essentially limitless power was great for world building and for imagination. and if a campaign ever did progress past 20th level, there were compelling options that actually spoke to the power to characters slowly progressing toward becoming gods... or for those that actually did ascend to godhood.","['spells', 'class', 'feats']",1m92fjq,Ideas and rules from older editions that didn't last into later editions

1666,n54vkkk,rampaging-poet,"nah, multi-classing and dual classing were different things!  though if you ever see a weird elminster build floating around where he has a lot of levels in different classes with no synergy it's because those levels were imported from the dual-classing days.


multiclassing was only available to demi-humans (elves, dwarves, halflings, etc), and chosen at character creation.  you'd pick two or three classes and earn separate xp for each.  you got the class features of both classes, and divided hp in half or thirds for each level.  an elf fighter/mage would start with 1d10+1d4 / 2 hp.  because fighter leveled faster than wizard they'd eventually hit fighter 2/wizard 1 and add another 1d10 / 2 hp plus better to-hit and more weapon proficiencies. and so on and so forth.


dual classing is similar to modern multi-classing with way more stringent requirements.  first, only humans could do it.  second, you needed a 15 or better in the prime requisite for the new class.  third, you actually lost all your class features except hp and saving thriws until your new class was higher level than your old class.  (or, well, didn't get any xp if you used your old class features?). so if you happened to roll a human with high strength and high intelligence it could sometimes be good to start as a fighter and duel-class into wizard once you had some levels and hp under your belt.  with the exponential xp curves of ad&d your new class could catch up pretty fast.


(and that is why ed greenwood's specialest little boy started his life as a thief then trained as a warrior when he got money then joined mystra's church and only then became a wizard: because in 2e that's how you got all the class features while only coming out like 1-2 levels behind a single-classed wizard.)",['class'],1m92fjq,Ideas and rules from older editions that didn't last into later editions

an orc barbarian/gloomstalker that uses a friggin' gigantic, brutal-to-pull longbow. he will shoot for an elf's eye every. time. he. can. filled with righteousness, firing arrows that are basically small ballista bolts, taunting the flower-bloods into mistakes and traps.

fighter of any subclass with gwm and archery feats is good.

1693,n2gu9et,swolf8100,"warlock is pretty easy for a new player, and i really enjoyed my fiend patron warlock. the simplest way to play it is go very blasty. make sure you take the eldritch blast cantrip, and then at level 2 take agonizing blast and repelling blast.

eldritch blast is going to be your main combat action, and agonizing blast lets you add your charisma modifier to the damage it does, and repelling blast means it will push enemies back 10 feet in addition to doing damage.

for spells at level 1, i like burning hands and hex. but armor of agathys could be good if you're worried about enemies closing on you.

once i hit level 3, i made sure to take misty step. if enemies ever got close, i'd just use the  misty step spell to teleport away and then blast them with eldritch blast.

this a combat focused approach, if that's what you're looking for.

and don't for a second listen to the chorus of people that repeat over and over again that the most optimal way of playing a blade singer is as a ranged mage.

i think it gives the impression that a gish blade singer is bad. and that's not the case. in my opinion, bladesingers are the best fighter/mage combination we have. and when played that way they are so fun! and they're still super effective.

and i like leaning into being an elven bladessinger!

my current bladesinger is a master weaponsmith who makes his own swords. and he's working researching his own unique spells! honestly? the build and the mechanics themselves are just fine, but it's the mythos and the feel of it that really inspires me to play. it's what inspired me to come up with such a rich character. 

and the best build is one that will keep you coming back to your character with excitement!

don't listen to the people saying that wizards are too complicated for a new player. nothing in 5th edition is really that complicated inherently. i feel that people over inflate the learning curve of certain things and class complexity is definitely one of them. the game has its complications? but you're going to face them no matter what class you pick.","['spells', 'class']",1lwt2wl,What's your favorite build for a DnD character?

1704,n2hcv9o,ybouy2k,"**for the best party face in history:** eloquence bard. it's busted for social checks and unsettling words is a great ability in combat. 

**for murder-maxing:** assassin rogue, beast or berserker barbarian, and sorcerer with quickened spell and true strike (2024 version, it wasn't good in the 2014 5th edition). evocation wizard for blasting. barbarians are fun because you take so many hits, wizards are fun because you get tons of spells (but have low hp and defenses.) 

**all-rounders:** battle master fighter, vengeance or devotion paladin, pretty much any rogue are all good at lots of stuff. bards are the most skill-heavy magic user, but clerics and rangers can be set up to be skilled at stuff outside of combat too. arcane trickster rogue is very versatile because you're essentially a rogue that's 1/3 of a wizard too.

**support:** bards are great at this, as are wizards and sorcerers if you can resist casting fireball every turn. druids can fill this role well. clerics are the classic support class - more defensive with best healing in the game (which was recently seriously buffed). 

my personal favorite is bard. best-in-class skills, magic, reasonable combat ability (less blasting, more support, but some blasting). you can heal, revivify... but above all, high charisma is so fun in my opinion. i love being the party face and doing risky persuasion/deception checks.

druids are one of the most flexible classes with the ability to change up spell list daily, wild shape options and solid survivability. in my campaign im playing with him 20 sessions in he is the only one who has not gone down once to date. part of it is i play fairly safe positioning wise. part of it is when things get bad i have lots of silly ways to escape. never underestimate the fog cloud into wild shape escape line. 

the only situations where my character feels somewhat useless is in social situations. this is because your spell list lack good social tricks. you have options to support your charismatic characters but... thats as good as you can really do.

1709,n2igfy1,Nurgle_Marine_Sharts,"honestly my favorite character that i've ever played was a really weird off-meta build that's probably objectively terrible but i felt powerful and adaptable, able to handle any situation that our dm threw at us. 

goliath barbarian/artificer multiclass, raised as a nobleman. as of right now in that campaign i am level 16, with 9 levels in barbarian and 7 in artificer.

for feats i took: 

-  great weapon master (hugely increases your potential damage output)

- eldritch adept - eyes of the rune keeper (lets me read any written language, came in handy so many times) 

- ability score improvement, 2 points into intelligence 

in battle i usually don't cast many spells (you can't cast spells while doing the barbarian rage, tradeoff is that it gives you huge damage resistance) but i cast plenty of them out of battle, utility spells and such. feather fall, identify, disguise self, message, longstrider, detect thoughts, jump, speak with dead etc. 

i also made good use of artificer things like steel defender and magical tinkering, and naturally i used my artificer infusions to buff my weapon and my gleaming half plate armor. 

in terms of crafting (best part about being an artificer!) i created: 

-  a wrist-mounted gun that attached to my left gauntlet, and over time i added extra barrels to it, so it is able to target multiple enemies similar to an eldritch blast, coupled with repeating shot it's a pretty strong ranged alternative for when i can't get within bonking range

- a suit of oni-bone and oni-leather armor (we got the materials from a slain boss) for our party's druid, which gave him a big ac boost early in the campaign

- a steampunk amphibious vehicle that we were able to use for navigating a series of isles and rocky coastlines to avoid detection from a rival nation's border patrols 

- a full set of sending stones for my whole party, but they are upgraded a bunch so they basically act as real-time comms system regardless of distance, super useful

- i upgraded my warhammer with a rocket engine on the back of the hammer's head, giving me 3 uses of a low level smite that knocks things backwards, and the charges refresh on long rest. i also upgraded it for siege capability so it does double damage to structures and auto-crits them. i can chew through a fortified door in one or two hits. 

- i buffed up my steel defender via a neural link tubing that went straight into my brain and linked it to the gorget of my armor. this allowed me to control the steel defender more easily and it resulted in the defender being able to use its own action and have its own turn, rather than me having to sacrifice an action to get it to attack something. i also boosted its stats for hp and damage/hit ratio. 

- i am still working on this one (since early in the campaign, it's taking a loooong time because it's so expensive and difficult/ambitious) but i'm basically making a magically powered siege apc that can seat the whole party. it has a main siege cannon, a dozer blade in the front for ramming fortifications, a rear-mounted mortar, and two flamethrower sponsons on either side. 

i also flavored all of my spells and cantrips. flavor is free and you can have fun getting creative with them, it's a big part of roleplaying as an artificer. firebolt was described as a shoulder mounted fireworks launcher, jump and longstrider were my armor being like fantasy power armor, disguise self was a holographic matrix that cloaked me completely, featherfall was little jet engines in my armguards and shinguards that slowed my descent, identify was putting objects into a scanning matrix cube.","['spells', 'feats']",1lwt2wl,What's your favorite build for a DnD character?

my first thoughts were this i want cha based and it must be nice and usable often. as often as possible if possible.

what i'm thinking of is a few things i want as many summons as possible. all of which can act on their turns. some good synergy between themselves. and ideally no conflicting stuff which would make it awkward to play too much. so

ofc lvl 1-5 will be warlock. pact witholding but considering celestial (healing and support) genie (dao/crusher combo, conc free flight with hover and ofc bottled respite) or goo (short range telepathy with summons) for different reasons.

origin feat: alert.

lvl 1 pact of the chain, lvl 2 eldritch mind and any pick of ur choice, lvl 5 investment or the chain master. and pick up arcana and calligraphy proficiency for scroll crafting.

go to strat use pseudodragon to sting and try to knock unconscious. if unsustainable use imp for advantage on eldritch blast. not the main goal of the build but it's consistent if your go to doesn't work.

level 5 of warlock pick up summon shadowspawn and get some move speed shut down with the despair form working for ya.

level 6 1 lvl in paladin and find a place to purchase paladin spell scrolls of summon steeds (v campaign dependsnt) and roll the arcana to summon it. or get your hands on a mizzium aparatus (dm dependant. but you could sweeten it by making it only function with find steed or smthn?) or an enspelled staff of find steed (most likley one to actually get. worst case find a paladin and ask them to craft it for u and pay them double the cost). multiclassing pally is optional but you get medium armor and shields and lay on hands to raise an ally as well as goodies like bless and a weapon mastery (maybe a slowing weapon and pick up true strike if you want to free up lance of lethargy for another invocation) 

you could continue going straight warlock from here if you go fathomless warlock with the tentacle

or if you're making this char at a higher level you can go creation bard 6 for song of creation.

pick up war caster on the way. ritual caster can be good, mage slayer, healer, chef, inspiring leader and any other thing that can buff your summons survivability will be good.

so you get 1 summon at level 1, another at 3 (if fathomless), another at 5 (have the party pally ideally fraft u an enspelled item), and further more another at 5 with shadowspawn. all of which can attack using your stuff or be used as mounts for mobility, the ability to reduce their move speed by up to 40ft and have a bunch of easily recreatable bodies on the field and all your prepped spells free to cast other utility stuff. and if you go creation bard you also get the goodies like inspiration, song of creation to create anything you'd need, more spell slots, access to the bard spell list and more plus a flying mount if you animate a broom or a saddle or smthn. which can not only auto slow but disengage, fly you with hover and use your ba to attack or just allow it to use it's action to dodge and move you around so effortlessly.

you could also go divine soul to keep them saving throws up better and also have an easier time keeping your summons up via the cleric spell list while still using cha as a caster.

over all it really is such a versatile build and if you have a smaller table where everyone is optimized with a few macros your turn should take about as much time as the fighters and you'll have a variety of strats and combos you can pull off solo.",['spells'],1lwt2wl,What's your favorite build for a DnD character?

1719,n2mb6rc,Buzz_words,"mid to low levels, melee ranger is kind of a house.

just 5 levels of ranger, any subclass works. 

two weapon fighting style. 

mastery in shortsword and scimitar. you're making 3 attacks per turn thanks to nick and extra attack, while feeding yourself advantage thanks to vex on the shortsword and leaving your bonus action available for hunters mark or to control a beastmaster pet.

if you wanna go even harder you take the dual wielder feat for another way to spend your bonus action to attack. now you're hitting 4 times per turn but your bonus action might get clogged (definitely do **not** go this route if you pick beastmaster)

the high volume of attacks synergizes well with hunters mark. essentially all your attacks will be 2d6+4 dmg (even if you don't take duel wielder, i'm assuming you increase dex to 18 or better *somehow* at level 4.)

ranger will also bring decent utility in case your dm throws that kind of thing at you. 

worried about food? goodberry; no you aren't.

stealth? pass without trace

other assorted ability checks? enhance ability and expertise.

is your fighter a team player with a push weapon? spike growth. (this is where we touch on most peoples *complaints* about 2024 ranger. spike growth requires concentration. so does hunters mark. the favored enemy feature pushes you into casting hunters mark. so many people feel pigeonholed. it's not *just* about spike growth of course, it's about a primary class feature occupying your concentration.)

for subclass: i do think they're all decent, but my personal favorite is fey wanderer. it adds misty step which is great on a melee character (but is another thing that wants your bonus action) a small amount of bonus damage every turn, and it even lets you push into the social skills if your party lacks a ""face"" character.

by comparison gloomstalker is probably better at going maximally apeshit on an enemy right now. their dreadful strike is much stronger than fey wanderers dreadful strikes (i just realized these have the same name...) but gloom stalkers can only be used a few times per day. where the fey wanderers never wear out. if you can coordinate with your party and game things to fight in the dark, gloomstalker becomes insane.

beastmaster is obvious, use it if you want a pet, don't combine it with dual wielder.

hunter is probably the most straightforward subclass. no expanded spell list and no pet to manage. it's hunters mark makes the dm tell you if the enemy has any weaknesses to target. as a ranger you probably can't target them but your party might be able to and you can share that information. then colossus slayer is *pretty much* always on free damage every turn. you're attacking 3 or 4 times per turn. *one* of those will hurt the enemy and enable colossus slayer for a following hit. this puts it ahead of fey wanderer but maybe still behind gloom stalker (again: depending on how many fights you take in a day.)",['class'],1lxe8nq,Best 5th level builds

for 4th level feat for ability score improvement (both in charisma)
choose fiend patron for scorching ray (and the extra temp hp. 

in spell selection make sure you have eldritch blast and hex then pick basically whatever else you want. probably armor of agathys for 15 reactive damage whenever you are hit. your eb will be so strong that you can use your slots for utility or aoe damage. but for pure damage it’s mostly eb and scorching ray (which the subclass gives you). misty step is a great way to get to high ground and give your self advantage on ranged attacks. 

background: basically pick anything that gives you charisma and dex. 

for race go goliath and pick fire giant for extra damage. 

for stats: get cha to 18 then go dex (for ac), wis (for saves), con (for hp)

now we’re all set up. here’s the plan:
start every fight with hex which gives an extra 1d6 whenever we attack. 
blast away with eldritch blast! at 5th level there’s 2 beams and agonizing blast gives each one additional +4 damage and each triggers hex. each cast nets an average 26 damage (min 12, max 40) and knocks enemies back up to 20 ft. 
for a giga damage cast scorching ray. with your level 3 slots sr had 4 2d6 bolts each triggering hex for a whopping 12d6. that’s an average of 42 damage (min 12, max 72). 
of course this all assumes you can hit your shots. try and get to high ground for advantage on ranged attacks. 
oh and armor of agathys! aoa gives 15 temp hp and deals 15 cold damage to anyone who hits you. the spell ends when we run out of temp hp (or in an hour) but our dark one’s blessing keeps replenishing our temp hp when kill things. plus aoa lasts a while and is non concentration so you can cast it before combat.",['spells'],1lxe8nq,Best 5th level builds

1723,n4oie26,Matt_Maker_,"ok, i haven't read the dresden files so all of my comments are going to be strictly from a designer's perspective, but anyhow:

lots and lots of flavour, absolutely adore it from that front, though i am kinda worried about the manifestation bit? like, if he doesn't manifest, what do the players even do for that round of combat? i'm also a bit confused about betrayal fragment. is it an action or just something he can just do on his turn, without using any action whatsoever? also, the timing of the second effect is a bit unclear, and it's therefore difficult ot evaluate it, but it seems like a good ability.

now for the actions and legendary actions:

* threadcut: very flavourful, though these type of abilities tend to be overly punishing to martials (who have few but effective features) and not punishing enough to spellcasters (""wow, i forgot one of the 15 spells i know at this level, whatever will i do?""). that said, i think the ""forgetting"" effect fading upon taking damage is good design as it doesn't make this attack too powerful.
* compelled misstep: good, but i would raise the damage a bit and have them take half as much damage (but no other effect) on a failed save. this boss seems to be a bit lacking in the damage department, so i think it warrants some ""free"" damage from time to time.
* echo suggestion: though i'm not personally a fan of turn-skipping effects, this is undeniably a powerful effect.
* mirror step: utility and good way of getting away from danger, so a good ability.
* silken command: it's unclear when the target gets to make the saving throw, but is otherwise a really powerful action, at worst being a turn skip and at best being free damage. i like that it doesn't necessarily restrict the creature's movement, just their action, which still leaves them with some choices.
* unravel: good feature, and it balances out the fact that threadcut isn't very punishing to spellcasters. also a bit of free damage never hurt.

overall, i feel like this boss is kinda lacking in the multitarget damage department, and maybe that was intentional, but at level 8-9 pcs are tanky and have good-ish saves. the flavour is on point and the mechanics are evocative, so no notes on that.",['spells'],1m6wgul,[OC] Looking for feedback on a custom Boss Statblock
1724,mzyodnj,Specific-Respect-340,"disclaimer: actual plays are not always a great source for raw (rules-as-written) information, as they sometimes get rules wrong or apply homebrewed changes to their games to make them more interesting or engaging for the audience to watch/listen to. that being said, they can provide some very fun inspiration on different ways to use abilities or different ways to characterize a class that you may not have thought of yourself.

if you are looking for actual plays specifically, critical role is going to be the most famous, as their first campaign has a bard in the main party who has some pretty great character progression throughout the series (especially in the latter half).

for something more cinematic and abbreviated, the second most popular option will probably be the dimension 20: fantasy high series (i think the whole first season is available for free on youtube). emily axford's character is a tiefling bard. be aware that that the setting and tone of that series is sort of like a fantasy version of a john hughes movie, so probably more modern-slanted than your campaign (i assume), but if you are looking at purely ability usage emily is quite a creative player who does a great job working with the tools at her disposal. she also took her bard's characterization in a very interesting and unique direction that i haven't really seen much of elsewhere. she's an unconventional bard, certainly, but that's part of why i recommend it - it seems you're looking to push outside the standard ""i roll to seduce the dragon"" bard stereotype.

i believe both these shows have extensive wikis where you can see the breakdown of character classes and abilities if you want to follow along with their builds/reference their abilities and stats, but be aware those wikis also often contain spoilers for later plot developments, if that matters to you.

i do repeat the disclaimer however that anything done in these actual plays is by the discretion of their table and dm, so definitely double check the rules-as-written and your table's specific rules/etiquette before adapting anything you find in any actual play.",['class'],1llbs2t,Looking for good bard roleplay examples
1725,n018z45,RedWizardOmadon,"the classic example is scanlan from critical role. he plays a typical promiscuous bard who is more about hedonism than heroism. as the campaign goes, his development deepens and transforms his character. the level of difficulty to replicate this cannot be overstated. sam regal is an amazing character actor and has an immediate recall of nearly infinite and songs and a penchant for chaos shenannigans that would(should?) kill most pcs.  still if you're studying bards this is a great place to start. 

next i would recommend stanley billings from there will be dungeons podcast. an under rated cast, but stanley billings shows just what sort of things are possible from the class. stanley doesn't really sing, he's a politician. using his gift of gab for persuasion and powers to heroic effect and political gain.

the dungeon run has a gnome bard (lilly dumblestuck) played by an actress named katie michaels who wrote actual songs for most of her bardic inspirations. awesome, but again high difficulty threshold.

high rollers - the dragon empire, the bard rowan is in ""tune"" with the sound of rocks and the earth. his take on the class is a great example of how to play the bard for those with little/no musical inclination (even though i think chris trot may have some actual talent there).",['class'],1llbs2t,Looking for good bard roleplay examples

_staff, legendary (requires attunement by a wizard)_

this glorious, multicolored, shifting head of this golden staff is constantly in motion, dancing and changing the dizzying array of colors on it in seemingly random fashion. for the observant, a deep mathematical pattern can be found, but many are simply awed by its appearance.

this staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. while holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to armor class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls. the staff has 20 charges for the following properties. the staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

**_kaleidoscopic casting._** when you cast a spell while attuned to this staff that deals cold, fire, lightning, thunder, necrotic, or radiant damage, you can expend 1 charge from this staff as part of the casting action to change the damage type to another on the previous list.

**_spells._** while holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save dc and spell attack bonus: chain lightning (6 charges), chromatic orb (3rd level, 2 charges), cone of cold (5 charges), flaming sphere (1 charge), fireball (5th level, 5 charges), ice storm (4 charges), lightning bolt (5th level, 5 charges), prismatic spray (7 charges), shatter (1 charge).

- remove + to ac
- remove + to saving throws
- remove the charge cost to switch damage types
- choose some more illusion coded spells for the built in option. 


i don't especially have an issue with the +2 to attack rolls or spell attack rolls, but as is it kinda just gives you every kind of target area (cone, radius, line etc) and says ""do whatever damage""

the power level of memory echo is extremely varied. scholar is extremely weak, as most of his spells don't care about advantage, and 1d4 extra damage is nothing. meanwhile, ruler and seer, combined with his boring monologue aura, are utterly ruinous to the party.

1749,mzrhhsn,unremarkablewanker32,"as an aussie, it's my duty to provide some ideas for the bearded dragon. my favourite scaled bush-friend. 

(wild) bearded dragons irl are timid until provoked. they have a formidable bite, powerful jaws that are very difficult to pry open, but are usually more bark than bite. their threat response is to inflate like a balloon and open their mouths wide, displaying size & a bright yellow mouth. bright colours are often seen as a threat in the animal world. 
bearded dragons are exceptionally bad swimmers.

****translating that into simple character traits for a cleric;****
- cheeks and belly involuntary puff out when threatened. maybe even puff up when casting spells.
- they bobble their head for perception checks.
- devoted to a dragon god, believes they will one day ascend to become a true dragon.
- can flavour that they use their bite instead of a mace. 

*rp will probably be minimal but here's a story anyway.*
- name: bazza ♂️, shazza ♀️, or chats (unisex.)
- they come from a sun-scorched land where dragons are revered. 
- they were raised by frill-necks, who are known for their exceptional speed and stunning frills. thus, our character has always been self-conscious for his short spikey beard and embarrassing puffy threat response. 
- joined the temple of the reverent flame and a divine dragon spoke to them of potential ascension to dragon-hood if they prove themselves worthy.
- left home on a pilgrimage to become worthy of dragon-hood and maybe find it in themselves to love their puffy selves.

**other lizards in australia you can have for background inspiration: **
- water dragons; similar look to bearded dragons but they don't puff up, they're longer, and sort of look like tiny iguanas.
- frilled neck lizards; stand on hind legs when threatened, and open their large neck frill. they will chase threats (including humans) and even climb said threatening animal. it works, because most people are scared of them. 
- thorny devil; can shoot blood from its eyes. is really really small.

if combat-focused and intense: you’ll want as many levels gloomstalker as possible (but a bare minimum of 5, for extra attack) before diving into druid tbh. honestly i’d recommend 8 levels ranger for wis save proficiency and an extra asi, but that’s a very “optimization”-focused way of thinking.

what i will say is this: the classes are thematically close enough to one another that you really don’t have to multiclass at all to get the flavor you want, especially under 2024 rules. you could go fully ranger all the way, and have magic initiate: druid from your background if you just want some cantrips and an extra spell. you could also take druidic warrior fighting style for even more cantrips, although defense, archery, blind fighting, and two-weapon fighting are probably “better”. then in rp if you want to portray yourself with a very magicky spellcaster druidic vibe then you can— but once initiative is rolled you’re a very powerful ranger who can bring some respectable damage to the table, and you haven’t hampered your ability to do so by taking druid levels just because it felt like you had to just for the vibes, if that makes sense",['spells'],1lzxw7j,Gloomstalker Druid Multiclass?

if you want the highest single target damage, you can't go wrong with paladin. paladins work great with greatswords too. they can dual wield (any class can dual wield) shorter swords, but that's not what they're great at.

as for the heavy metal bard, sure, if your dm is cool with it, why not. the type of music you play has absolutely no actual bearing on how the game works. however bards use their instruments to play music and to cast spells (through playing music), not to hit their enemies over the head with. for that purpose they generally have a rapier, or some other kind of melee weapon.

i do think martial classes are a good pick if it's your first time, there's a little less strategy and decisions to make than with spellcasters. going off of what kind of character you want to play, you could very easily do a fighter with a big sword or dual-wielding. also, for general reference, reflavouring is your friend. if you don't want to waste your bonus action on dual-wielding (some subclasses rely a lot on bonus actions), use a greatsword mechanically and ask your dm if you can flavour the 2d6 of damage as you dual wielding and doing 1d6 with each sword.

1770,n3tdhna,sax87ton,"so hitting things with swords is pretty common in d&d. 

fighter are the most basic option and can do any style of fighting well. both two weapon and great weapon work well with them. solid and reliable option in all metrics. 

barbarian are more about getting hit and keeping moving. still a good option for great weapon fighting. in particular they can make it easier to hit in exchange for making it easier to get hit, which you can combine with the great weapon master feat which makes you less accurate but you do more damage. 

ranger has some solid two weapon fighting support. at low levels hunters mark makes two weapon fighting my personal pick for best melee  dps. the spells they use do slightly more damage per hit, but they stay up for multiple hits, and two weapon fighting gets the most hits. but they get most of their combat support from spells rather than always on class features. 

paladin can do great weapon stuff. their deal is they have spells and can use those spell slots to do big damage when they hit with a sword. so they are known for big explosive swings. 

so ranger is lots of smaller hits and paladin is one big hit. 

if the vibe you’re going for is melee fighting i don’t recommend bard. they are full casters and specialize in like enchantment and beguilement. think like pied piper. some of them can do combat but they will not be as good at it as the primary melee options. i once had a game where a bard had the goal of being “the world’s greatest swordsman” and literally every other character at the table was better than him with a sword.

just to be clear, most of the melee bard subclasses like swords and valor you are still primarily a spell caster and you will be casting spells every turn, just sometimes swing a sword too. spell caster first, swordsman second. if that fits the fantasy you’re going for then cool. 

now that said you don’t have to be a bard to be a musician. the entertainer background allows you to play instruments and i think you start with one iirc. so you can be fighter class, musician by trade.

my recommendation would be to *not* multiclass. instead on level 8 take a feat. 

i'd recommend:

- fey touched - easiest to make it work with assasin. misty step is my favourite spell and it would let you close the gap to enemy spellcaster or get out of sticky situation, after assasinating high value target in combat. also you get a 1st level spell, which will also help with varaiety.

- shadow touched - you get invisibility, which requires more setup and is generally harder to use, especially that you want to attack turn one every combat. but maybe it would be more up your alley. 

- magic initiate - just find a 1st level spell you like, for cantrips take booming blade (if you're melee) and minor illusion or mold earth. to create cover for easier stealthing in combat.

i think these feats would help with varaiety in your build, while also not being detrimental.

if you really want to multiclass, consider what features you want from other classes. full casters at level have 2 spell slots and know a handfull of level 1 spells and cantrips. so to get more and powerful spells you'd have to do a detour in your leveling.

if you must, i'd recommend 3 levels in vengance paladin for vow of enmity, for consistent advantage and a few leveled spells.

if you are committed to multiclassing i'd advise against sorcerer since they take several lvls to work so it will take forever to make an effective build. i'd suggest grabbing a few lvls of warlock. a single lvl of warlock will get you a pact slot that recharges on a short rest and eldrich blast and a subclass if you are playing base 5e. hex blade will give you medium armor, shields and crit on 19. 3 lvls will get you 2 2nd lvls spells meaning invisibility or hold person which would be nutty on a rogue. invocations can also be alot cooler than spells you could use repelling blast to push ppl into disadvantageous positions to help give yourself sneak attack, mask of many faces would turn you into a superspy, and the devil sight darkness spell is infamous for anything but terrifying on a rogue that gets sneak attack on every attack.

a sorcerer dip is very precise and honestly if you multiclass from rogue into something you need some way to compensate for the hit to your sneak attack dice increase, warlock hex/hunters mark or aiming to get an extra attack are rather traditional. just dabbling into sorcerer by itself isn't going to do much - you are already a rogue spec with no spellcasting, the main use of multiclassing into sorcerer is how metamagic and exchanging spell slots benefits other classes, there isn't much synergy in this case.


i wouldn't suggest going for what your thinking, weakening your sneak attack will not really trade off well in the long term and will set you behind without a plan. picking up warlock might be a better shout, since you can pick up a couple of levels and get hex to maintain damage, have extra spell options and could get improved dark vision and infinite false life casts like you'd like from the sorcerer levels but overall a bit better.",['spells'],1lx8bsi,Rogue Multi classing

avoid homebrew character options like the plague. they are all badly unbalanced and would be like playing skyrim for the first time with cheatcodes and a ton of mods you dont understand. it makes trying to play the real game later never feel like a good game.

give yourself the opportunity to learn the game. 

read the rules for you character and anything they can do. this is gonna include all the magic casting rules(though you don't need to read all the spells yet) since you want to use magic which is a lot more complicated than a martial character. 

use your real features. dont try to ""rule of cool"". rule of cool moments need to come up naturally to be ""cool"". they also still work off what your real features can do, but bend the rules slightly for the moment. you dont want to ""break"" the rules or expect a ""bent' rule to be permanent. if you try to force them, you just hold up the game for what usually turns out to something way lamer than you think its gonna be. dont argue with the dm about it.


make a character that wants to go with the party on the adventure. dont make an edgy loner and force the rest of the party to beg you to join them. that makes for a terrible character thats a drain on the table.

""lean in"" to whatever is happening. enjoy the low rolls as much as the high rolls. have fun with the way your character fails things, especially things they are usually really successful at. have the brain fart on your check to remember a detail about you devoted area of study, instead of complaining about your nat 1 history check. you can make those failure fun with roleplay.

take your turns quickly. if you dont know what to do, have a default cantrip or action to fall back on in combat if you cant think of the ""perfect"" spell. dont hold the table hostage while you read your whole spell list on your turn.

pay attention to the other players turns too!  a lot of new players think other players turns are important to them. they are. 

have a back up character idea. your character can die. dont go overboard trying to write your characters story. only their backstory is written up to the point you start playing. after that, all of the story is written at the table with the rest of the players. expecting or prewriting what has to happen to your character is a recipe for disappointment at best or holding your table hostage at worst. be invested in your character's present, but dont over invest in their completely unknown future as their player.","['spells', 'class']",1lkz9mx,"New to DND, any tips or things I should know about?"

they, the dm's, gave you no choice to choose what your character is either race, stat or class wise; a bit constrictive but fair.

your level 4 feat is ""mounted combatant"" aka, ""you attack me and not my steed"" feat, highly specific but fine.

you enter a ""cave"" which in dnd can mean anything really when it comes to all of the details. depth, length, hazardous terrain, blind spots for enemies to be in, etc. not explained at all, based on what you wrote, which is a problem.

if you're not interested in the actual gameplay abilities of a bard, you can just call yourself a bard, and not take a level in bard. you could also take the magic initiate feat for a couple bard spells and cantrips. i'm assuming you already have the artist background and can play an instrument.

also, an important consideration is your charisma score. if it's under 13 you can't multiclass into bard, so that makes it very easy to decide. depending on how high it is, that will also influence your choice of spells",['spells'],1lve530,Swashbuckler to bard

if you play a race with a level adjustment of +1 that means that if you are a level 2 crusader, you count as a level 3 character for purposes like your dm determining what monsters to throw at you. 

so if you're starting at level 14 and you pick goliath, which has a level adjustment of +1, you'll actually be a lv.13 crusader with a +1 level adjustment for a encounter level of 14, not a level 14 crusader.

in general most races are not worth their level adjustment, especially at low levels. however, goliath is one of the few races that is arguably worth its level adjustment and the difference between being lv.13 and lv.14 in a class is a much smaller difference than being lv.1 vs. lv.2 in a class, so starting at higher level makes the level adjustment less notable.",['class'],1lu507i,DnD 3.5 Need advice/help with creating a character

1839,n04jvvn,Zestyclose_Wedding17,"all three spells require concentration, so you’d only have one active at a time. each of them have their benefits, so it’s really just a matter of how you want to play.

hex is a straightforward 1d6 additional damage per hit against your chosen target. it has some out of combat uses as well, but that’s its main purpose. it is also a bonus action to cast, so it doesn’t eat up your attack for a round. as a first level spell, that upcasts to extend its duration, this really is a bread and butter spell for many warlocks.

enlarge is a straight 1d4 additional damage, but its better application is for tactical positioning. getting up to size large makes it so that enemies have that much more work to do if they want to get around you. sometimes, you can outright block the whole area by standing in the right spot to protect your allies. this spell is an action though.

shadow blade is a bonus action, but it effectively replaces your weapon for the combat. at its lowest level, it’s 2d8 damage per attack, but you don’t have to constantly change your target as with hex whenever they go down. at higher levels, the damage does ramp up, and there is a nice little synergy with the lighting so you really are encouraged to fight in dim light or darkness (with darkvision, of course). if you happen to have a really good magic weapon though, the spell loses some of its luster.",['spells'],1llrjl6,Metamagic adept for an EK
1840,n26efpf,Atharen_McDohl,"there are actually a lot of problems with this. the big one is that glyphs can't be moved more than 10 feet from where they are cast, so you'd have to keep stationary or constantly recast the spell, wasting all your other spell slots to fill the glyph. but that one has been explained to you. it's also arguable that your skin doesn't count as a ""surface"" for the purposes of the spell, but as far as i'm concerned that's a pointless argument to have when there are so many other issues.

as for counterspelling a spell which hits you, that doesn't work. by the time the spell hits you, it's too late to counter it. you need to counter the spell as it's being cast, which means you shouldn't even know what the spell's target is when you counter it. you could set the glyph to trigger counterspell whenever a creature other than you (and your party) casts a spell within 30 feet or whatever, but expect to waste a lot of glyphs and upset a lot of random non-hostile mages if you do that.

summon lesser demons the way you described using it in another comment is an even worse idea, if you can believe it. but there's a way to rescue that one, at least. glyph of warding has a special little clause that a lot of people miss: ""if the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it."" if you trigger the glyph yourself, you're the intruder. but if you set the glyph to trigger when a creature attacks you or something, then it would work more or less as intended. though it's also worth noting that by the text of glyph, summon lesser demons might not be an eligible candidate for storing inside a glyph. you can only store spells which target a single creature or an area, and summon lesser demons doesn't appear to do so. personally i'd say that it's not raw but it is rai and is probably an oversight. i'd allow it.

as for tidal wave, just remember that if you store a spell which targets an area, that area is centered on the glyph. if you're storing the glyph on your own body... could still be a fun tactic, but you're guaranteeing that you'll be caught in the spell.",['spells'],1lvgwgn,Need Help With A Supplement Ruling

cantrips are largely personal choice but gfb or booming blade are straight upgrades to your damage output. mage hand is required by your subclass.

for the melee tank i'll use either full plate or studded leather (one point of ac difference) and always use a shield. that's either 20 or 19 passive ac and with blur and all attacks are at disadvantage.

as i said, your int with an at will almost never be high enough to use offensive spells so you could even drop int if you really wanted.

you could take wizard levels but you'll just be a bad wizard or a lackluster rogue. rogue scales with sneak attack damage which comes from rogue levels. wizards scale with spell level and slots which comes from caster levels.

battle master is still my top recommendation. a shield and defense fighting style is +3 to your ac which is an immediate boost to survivability.

you shouldn't need to rely on a familiar to get sneak attack. advantage helps, but you only need an enemy of your target within 5 ft of it. aka you and another frontliner should be working together, tag teaming enemies. that way you get sneak attacks, even on attacks of opportunity.

1878,n31vh1t,rollingdoan,"the key thing to understand in 5e/5.5e is that multiclassing is almost never a path to making a character stronger. it is a path to making your character more specialized. if what you specialize in is good for your particular game, or is good for combat specifically, then the multiclass should work fine.


when you multiclass without a plan you can severely handicap a character and if the plan isn't good then the same can happen. most games are quite low difficulty and so if a character idea is very fun to you this isn't necessarily a reason not to do it.


the next thing to understand is that the best part of full casters (bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, wizard) is that they get *lots* of options. every odd numbered level you get a whole box of new toys and at almost every level you get more slots to fill with those toys. when you start to multiclass you stop getting those new toys. this can result in very detrimental outcomes.


take one of your ideas: go 2 cleric, then 2 druid.


this character has 4 1st-level and 3 2nd-level spell slots, but because it is only level 2 in each class it does not know any 2nd level spells. it has both the druid and cleric spell lists, but only 1st level spells and cantrips. when this character levels, if you take druid or cleric, then you'll have 3rd level slots and 2nd level spells.


compare to 4 cleric. this character has another asi or feat, which is great. this character has the same 4/3 spell slots. this character only has the cleric spell list, but has access to 2nd level cleric spells. you indicate 5e, which means that one of those 2nd level spells could be spiritual weapon, a non-concentration spell that gives you a solid bonus action for the duration. when this character levels you gain 3rd level slots and spells. 3rd level spells are famously good. this character will both be stronger and have more options.


if you were to go monk things get far worse as you not only lose the spell levels, but the spell slots too. in exchange you'll have 18 ac instead of the 20 you could have if you had 15 str, or the 19 you would have with medium armor. a terrible tradeoff.","['spells', 'class']",1lzifii,Thoughts on this build for my character?

1881,mzzul3i,FlohrSynth,"vex has nothing to do with the number of attacks. 

in terms of nick:

anyone can use their action to attack with a light weapon (adding str or dex mod to the damage) and then use their bonus action to attack with a different light weapon in their offhand (without adding anything to the damage die). 

if you are a class with weapon masteries and you use a weapon with the nick property, once per turn you can also make an offhand attack as part of that attack action (still without adding anything to the damage die).

if you have the two weapon fighting fighting style, you can now add your modifier to the damage of the offhand attack.

if you have the dual wielder feat when you take attack action with a light weapon you can also make an additional offhand as a bonus action.

i’m sure some people will find ways to try to take more attacks than this but this is my understanding of the raw. the number of attacks without any additional magical effects (such as haste):

at level 2 as a two weapon fighter you can make a maximum of two attacks per turn. once you get the dual wielder feat you could also use your bonus action and make 3. once you get extra attack at level 5 you can make a total of 4 attacks per turn. or 3 and still have a free bonus action. i’m about to run a campaign for some new players using the 2024 rules for the first time and i predict the dual wielding ranger will be very strong. i agree with people’s complaints about high level progression but level 1-10 seems great.",['class'],1llhydl,Just starting a campaign with 2024 ranger : I’m trying to research the final rulings for Vex/Nick/Dual Wielder

1884,n2vvy2x,spector_lector,"""players were set up to lose the fight?""

there's one problem.
you don't dictate outcomes. you create factions, with motives and resources, who go about their business. if the party wants to intervene, how and when they do so may be a total surprise for you, and the faction(s). 

you never know what the party will decide to do, not how the dice will behave. so, you don't create a plot arc of predetermined scenes with planned outcomes.  that's not a rollercoaster i would want to be on. you create obstacles and threats to the pcs' goals. maybe they overcome those threats, maybe they flee from them, maybe they succumb to them. that's for their decision- making and the dice to determine. 

""they had more resources than i thought""

there's another problem. 
either you play with mature adults you trust, or you have to track resources yourself. 

personally, i only game with adults so i could (and do) leave the campaign notebook open on the table when i go into the other room for bio breaks or to get something. they're not the kind of people who would read a book backwards, or steal money from my wallet. if they deal massive damage to baddie and then 2 round later realize that their sleek doesn't work that way, they'd fess up voluntarily on their turn and say, ""i messed up. the baddie should still have 159hp. my bad."" 

so if you even suspect it was intentional, you're spending time with the wrong people, imho. 

but you could have a single document item,  visible, and editable by all. and on it, you could have players check boxes when they expend resources.  like, they fire an arrow,  so they put s mark next to their name. everyone sees it.  it's just a simple thing they do when conducting their turn. when the next player casts a spell, they edit the same doc, writing ""lvl 2"" next to their name. everyone sees it.  we play face to face and this paper is floating around the minis on the battlemat, so it's visible and editable by everyone at the table. i can glance at it if i want to remember how many crossbow bolts jake has used at the end of an encounter. 

if you want to make it even easier, there are many templates online for ready-made resource trackers that have boxes to check for spells, ranged ammo, hp, and other resources.

that aside, if having half(?) of the party turn into borderline unintelligent walls of meat breaks all of the encounters you had in mind for them, you might need to think about coming up with some more engaging fights. at bare minimum, areas where these giant whales can get into place to protect their party members from one direction also have plenty of space for enemies to bypass them in the rest of the 360 degrees that they're not in, right? if one whale each covers front and back, that still leaves both sides *plus* above and below. use them. use the whales' lack of intelligence. use the fact that they need direct commands to do *anything* useful. have an enemy dispel the polymorph.

hidden ace applies to any spell of a spell list you have raw access to. it isn't nor can be attributed to either deadly deal or spray of cards; however if you know the spray of cards spell, you can make that spell be your hidden ace, at whatever level (2nd level or higher) of a spell slot you decide.

the spectral card attack from deadly deal isn't actually casting a spell, it is simply a ranged spell attack and doesn't have any restrictions otherwise. if you use your hidden ace as a bonus action, you can then use your action for whatever you want (except casting a spell that isn't a cantrip), but since deadly deal isn't a spell, you are in the clear.

subclass: draconic sorcerer.   
spell options: mage armour and shield so no one can ever hit you (you can even tank yourself like this). your mage armour could look like spines or scales growing on your body. i also like enlarge reduce because making a big dino smaller or your party member big enough to grapple a dino will feel good. you get some pretty flavourful spells with draconic sorcery. you could also lean heavy into poisonous stuff with spells like stinking cloud, ray of sickness (it poisons when it hits with no save), slow (any debuff can be poison theme really).   
metamagic: quickened spell and heightened spell.   
tank gimmick option: get in mellee with the tough feat + war caster (great anyway) and true strike your way to victory with quickened spell and opportunity attacks. alter self can add to the feel of this with natural weapons that make unarmed strikes (because they are weapons they work with true strike... maybe, i would allow it, its not that good but it feels great). weirdly i can see this also working from level 6 with a level of monk thrown in so you can grapple with your dex, then take the grappler feat, then can you grapple with true strike and alter self being both an unarmed attack and weapon attack? a flying dino sorcerer with true strike grapple lol.

you might want a warlock with the improved pact weapon invocation. i'm not familiar with 5.5, but in 5e you can easily use misty step to quickly get around the battlefield, and there's a spell called invisibility at the same spell level (2nd). this is the skipping and invisibility casting. a great old one warlock could work, especially if you really want to lean into the archotech flavoring, but any subclass could be viable and be reflavored -- archfey would be best, seeing as you get a way to teleport and turn invisible on taking damage once per rest at 6th level, as well as a lot of stuff relating to charming and again, invisibility. word of serenity has a pretty much 1:1 in 5e in the form of calm emotions, which is on archfey's spell list.

alternatively, you could play an eldritch knight; you'll have lots of extra attacks and action surge for trigger happy, good spells if not nearly as many as a full caster (you will be going invisible and skipping yourself a lot less), and arcane charge at 17th for that teleporting you wanted. for being more accurate, maybe be an elf or half-elf for elven accuracy, a race-specific feat. ek's are also fighters, who can use heavy armor (given how much you seem to be going for a ranged build, you'll probably end up going for light armor and a high dex score. maybe try to gun for ac-increasing magic items?). you can also choose from a few options of feats for misty step without expending spell slots. i prefer this over a warlock, but i'm a big fan of fighters so i guess i'm biased.

for his medical skill, the healer feat could work, but you'd really be fine with proficiency in medicine. for fast wound healing, i guess durable kind of applies but it's not a feat i would take, d&d pcs already heal super fast anyway. never sleeps would be difficult without being an elf or something. i guess you could be an undying warlock, which also removes your need to eat for anything but roleplay, but that doesn't fit your character too well and you'd have to be 10th level.

for art, proficiency in painter's tools, maybe? you can pick it up as part of your backstory's proficiencies, but it's not very useful. 

you could take the gunner feat from tce which lets you use guns properly (a musket is 1d12), but you'd honestly be fine with a longbow, which works with warlocks as a pact weapon. it's barely any difference and a lot of dms don't allow guns.

for royalty stuff, take the noble background (or just position of privilege from that, and make your custom background with those item proficiencies you wanted). this is mostly just roleplay flavor, anyway.

another interesting one for your wizard would be magic initiate cleric or druid to get some spell picks you wouldn't otherwise have access to. really opens up some doors for what a wizard can do.

healing word and cure wounds are both abjuration spells, so you could heal yourself or others *and* recharge your arcane ward at the same time.

every party wants guidance, can anybody else cast it? 

and you're a human so you prolly gotta get the light cantrip from somewhere, right? if you take it via magic initiate cleric then that frees up another wizard cantrip pick?

alert is another generically good one, but especially as a wizard you'll probably end up with some spells that will feel game winning if you go before the enemy.

avoid crafter like the plague.

healer doesn't really work for this character.

musician is great if your party remembers to spend inspiration. like from a table-wide point of view it is even better than lucky.

savage attacker and tavern brawler are not really relevant.

skilled is probably the most medium feat in the game. if you coordinate with your party and notice any significant gaps then *maybe?* but there's a lot of better options.

the magic initiates are a favorite of mine and can enable interesting builds like shillelagh paladin or just give more versatility like blade cantrips to a fighter or healing word to a wizard

alert is great, moreso for spellcasters that want to drop a large aoe thing before enemies move or before your barbarian stands in the center of where you wanted to fireball. this is lower down the ranking of all your turn entails is ""i hit the singular guy""

musician: a few rerolls in your party via heroic inspiration, which is helpful when someone just failed a save on a really bad save or suck spell or whatever. because this recharges in short rest and you get more of these than lucky, i would say it's better than lucky

lucky is universally helpful, but boring. you get a couple of free advantages or enemy attack disadvantages per day. i personally frequently forget to use them. they won't create a new build or new play style, they're just a nice thing to have 

skilled: more skills, this is always a good thing

tough: extra hit points is good 👍

1926,n36jold,Buzz_words,"so there's several problems for valor bard. but there are also solutions.

the first problem is your attribute spread.

your spear needs strength. your spells need charisma. your armor class (yes even with medium armor) needs at least *some* dexterity. everybody needs constitution.

the real conflict is between strength and charisma. (you only need 14 dex to ""fill out"" medium armor. and con is a problem every character needs to solve)

there are ways to mitigate this issue, depending on the level range you're playing at.

so option one is to focus on strength and just pick spells that will work anyway. i don't care how low your charisma is: i promise not to *dodge* if you cast longstrider on me. (personally, i hate this option. but there **are** several good spells that can help this style of build work.)

option 2 works extremely well at levels 1-5: focus on charisma, and just use the new true strike cantrip for your melee attacks. true strike allows you to make weapon attacks and substitute your charisma instead of str. problem solved, right?

except: valor bards get extra attack at level 6, and while valor bard does get the special *extra good* version of extra attack that allows them to swap **one** of those attacks for a cantrip... they can't swap *both.* so now one of your attacks must be made with strength. which is probably low. (this is still an imperfect solution, but i like it much better because you still get to be **all** of a bard, instead of being restricted to a tiny cross section of your spell list)

another option to settle this problem once and for all is to multiclass into warlock and take their pact of the blade invocation. this makes 1 weapon you like the most use charisma. that becomes a trait of the weapon, so it works with your extra attack. (you'd still want one of those attacks to be a true strike *anyway* because true strike gets a small amount of bonus damage from game wide cantrip scaling) this solves the problem but now you spent a whole level on it? does your dm allow multiclassing? does a warlock dip work with your character concept? do you care enough that both attacks are good instead of one of them being good and the other one being terrible?

the second problem is ""what are you doing with your hands?""

well, you're holding a spear and a shield, duh. that's the whole character. but then how are you performing the somatic (hand wavery) components of spells? 

now this problem is easier to solve. valor bard can use weapons as their spellcasting focus, and spellcasting focii can substitute material components, while also incidentally satisfying somatic components. but there are rare spells that need a somatic component (hand waving) but do not use a material component (thus a spell focus is not relevant) so maybe be careful with your spell selection?

**or** take the warcaster feat. it does several things, but one of which is basically ""you can wave your hands while they're full"" so you never need to worry about the somatic component again. now it might feel bad to have to take a feat just to cast your spells, but it does so many *other* useful things that you might just take it anyway.

so that's all the big points i can think of. 

if it were me; i'd take true strike right at level 1, warcaster at level 4, and a single level of warlock around lvl 6 or 7. (i'd also just use a trident or one of the many other 1 handed d8 martial weapons instead. valor bard gets martial weapon proficiency so you might as well use it? nothing is stopping you from saying your trident looks like a spear?)","['spells', 'weapons', 'class']",1lzyy5p,"Im very new to D&D.

1927,n35gipp,wathever-20,"you'll need warcaster so you don't have a huge headache with somatic components and occupied hands. you'll probably also want one level into warlock for charisma attacks. after that, not much different than any other sword and board character. maybe take a second level in warlock eventually for agonizing + repelling booming blade. but there is very little reason to take a spear unless you want to use pam, as the spear is a simple weapon and therefore will have lower damage than similar martial weapons. outside of pam, the trident is just a better spear. and pam is very hard for you to afford as you already have a feat tax with warcaster. if you are in high levels (after bard 14) pam is not worth it as you already have a bonus action attack almost every turn.

edit: as u/yojo0o pointed out, you can stow your weapon on your turn to cast spells, and since bard don't get nearly as many reaction spells that need somatic and not material components as wizards with shield/absorb elements/counterspell, you should be fine. it will mean you won't be able to opportunity attack with your weapon in those offturns where you have it stowed.

warcaster is still an amazing choice. bards get a ton of great concentration spells, and you being in melee put that in a huge threat. warcaster helps with that, as well as giving you better opportunity attacks, especially if you take booming blade and the warlock invocations.","['spells', 'weapons']",1lzyy5p,"Im very new to D&D.

i also understand feeling as though the fewer, less restrictive rules in 5e can make improvising/homebrewing feel more approachable and less intimidating. i think that too will diminish as you gain pf2e experience, as i was very hesitant to bend any rules as a newer 5e dm. in both 5e and pf2e, every rule can (and arguably is meant to be) broken if it results in more fun for you and your players, as this is the ultimate goal of the game. i generally don’t break rules without reason, but that point is good to keep in mind when you get overwhelmed trying to play 100% rules as written.

i personally love the three-action economy of pf2e and the more specialized class choices. i think they give players a lot of gameplay-based ways to engage with their characters, without having to rely on roleplay. though, admittedly i’ve never been on the gm-end of that. i still love 5e though, and there’s nothing wrong if that’s your preference (even if wotc sucks). at the end of the day, it’s about what’s fun for you and your players.",['class'],1lt1412,Thoughts on DnD 5e(2014) and PF2

pf2e (and paizo generally) are in love with phantom depth. complexity for the sake of complexity that doesn't really increase the number of viable options--it just hides them in a morass of things that are (at best) good for someone else or (at worst) just all around bad.  this creates a sea of traps for anyone who doesn't want to design a pc top to bottom.
 sure, you've got choices. but they're basically dictated for the large part by your main character concept. want to go sword and shield? here are the 5 feats you need. and you need weapon runes a and b. anything else? yeah, that may be good for someone else, but it's a trap for you. all sword and board fighters end up looking and acting very similar. etc. tons of options, very few of which actually are useful for any given character. so mostly phantom choices.

overdesigned is a good word for it.

this is a design pattern that many games fall into. basically, it's looking at the surface rather than the core. designing complexity for its own sake rather than accepting complexity as a necessary consequence sometimes. designers copy the surface elements of something that worked (at least in principle), thinking that's the important stuff. but really it's the core that gives life to that surface. 

 it's cargo cult design. and it's a nasty nasty temptation. because lots of times we don't understand what the core is. even the ones who built it.


for example, the 3 action system. i've heard it argued that the pf2 approach allows players maximum freedom. any complaints about how everything is an action (tm) are typically handwaved by stating that you can do more per turn because there are 3 actions. however, 5e characters can easily do more than 3 pf2 actions worth of stuff in a turn. in a lot of ways, 5e's action system is more complex and nuanced, and takes a lot of lessons and features from previous editions. if there is a benefit to how pf2 handles actions, it's that its hypothetically easier to learn and gm.

1938,n0flgax,_dharwin,"first, if you switched to 2024 rules, i'd ask if you can just remake the character. same class and stats, but be allowed to change everything else.

one of the major changes in 2024 was the addition of new/different ways for martials to get in on skill checks. for example, barbarians can now use primal knowledge to use str for any of 5 different skills, which is a huge buff to their skill utility.

another major change was the addition of origin feats and, relevant to your case, skilled which grants 3 skill proficiencies. again, this might mean you can either get more proficiencies than you had before or other players may be able to cover gaps which once existed.

taken together, it means you may not need to fill the roll of a skill monkey which would free you up to pursue other things with your feats. you could possibly take two +1 feats to int so you still hit your cap without investing in secondary stats.

if you don't need to serve as the skill monkey/rogue replacement you can swap your con and dex scores. 14 dex is enough for m.armor if you don't get the feat and 18 con is awesome for both survivability and concentration checks. breastplate + 2 is the same as studded leather + 4, and equally good at stealth checks.

btw, what is your race? there are some excellent racial feats which you might consider.

feats to consider:

1. ***warcaster*** may still be needed for spells which require somatic components but *not* material. if a spell uses both you only need one hand holding the material component (or in this case, arcane focus). if it does *not* have a material component, then you do indeed need a free hand. another point in favor of warcaster is you can bump your wis, getting a bonus to the associated skills and save.
2. i would highly consider ***resilient (wis).*** bonus to associated skill checks and the obvious boost to wis saves. as you get higher level, your concern is hard disabling affects. phys saves are usually for damage or movement/prone. you have absorb elements and a nice pool of hp to deal with damage. mental saves are for things like stunned, charm, mind control, etc. in other words, mental saves become increasingly important as the game goes on and wis is the most common of all mental saves. you'll also get a bonus to wis and a bump to all those skills.
3. ***mage slayer*** is an interesting option. the stat bonus not so much but the fact you can hit enemies multiple times, particularly with eb, means a ton of concentration saves at disadvantage. plus the auto-success on a mental save is great (as discussed earlier)
4. ***chef*** is an excellent pickup for anyone and helps the team survive long adventuring days.","['spells', 'class', 'feats']",1lnifyt,Feat Advice Needed
