  'text': "4 \nINTRODUCTION \nr \nT'S GOOD TO BE THE DU NGEON MASTER! NOT ONLY \nd? y~u get to tell fantastic stories about heroes, \nv1llams, monsters, and magic, but you also get \nto create the world in which these stories live. \nWhether you're running a D&amp;D game already \nor you think it's something you want to try, this \nbook is for you. \nThe Dungeon Master's Guide assumes that you know \nthe basics of how to play the D&amp;D tabletop roleplaying \ngame. If you haven't played before, the DuNGEONS f!f&gt; \nDRAGONS Starter Set is a great starting point for new \nplayers and DMs. \nThis book has two important companions: the Player's \nHandbook, which contains the rules your players need \nto create characters and the rules you need to run the \ngame, and the Monster Manual, which contains ready-to-\nuse monsters to populate your D&amp;D world. \nTHE DUNGEON MASTER \nThe Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force \nbehind a D&amp;D game. The DM creates a world for the \nother players to explore, and also creates and runs \nadventures that drive the story. An adventure typically \nhinges on the successful completion of a quest, and \ncan be as short as a single game session. Longer \nadventures might embroil players in great conflicts that \nrequire multiple game sessions to resolve. When strung \ntogether, these adventures form an ongoing campaign. \nA D&amp;D campaign can include dozens of adventures and \nlast for months or years. \nA Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As the \narchitect of a campaign, the DM creates adventures \nby placing monsters, traps, and treasures for the other \nplayers' characters (the adventurers) to discover. As \na storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize \nwhat's happening around them, improvising when the \nadventurers do something or go somewhere unexpected. \nAs an actor, the DM plays the roles of the monsters and \nsupporting characters, breathing life into them. And as a \nreferee, the DM interprets the rules and decides when to \nabide by them and when to change them. \nInventing, writing, storytelling, improvising, acting, \nrefereeing-every DM handles these roles differently, \nand you'll probably enjoy some more than others. It \nhelps to remember that DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS is a \nhobby, and being the DM should be fun. Focus .on the \naspects you enjoy and downplay the rest. For example, if \nyou don't like creating your own adventures, you can use \npublished ones. You can also lean on the other players \nto help you with rules mastery and world-building. \nThe D&amp;D rules help you and the other players have \na good time, but the rules aren't in charge. You're the \nDM, and you are in charge of the game. That said, your \ngoal isn't to slaughter the adventurers but to create a \ncampaign world that revolves around their actions and \ndecisions, and to keep your players coming back for \nmore! If you're lucky, the events of your campaign will \necho in the memories of your players long after the final \ngame session is concluded. \nINTRODUCTION \nHow TO UsE THIS BooK \nThis book is organized in three parts. The first part \nhelps you decide what kind of campaign you'd like to \nrun. The second part helps you create the adventures-\nthe stories-that will compose the campaign and \nkeep the players entertained from one game session \nto the next. The last part helps you adjudicate the \nrules of the game and modify them to suit the style of \nyour campaign. \nPART 1: MASTER OF WORLDS \nEvery DM is the creator of his or her own campaign \nworld. Whether you invent a world, adapt a world from \na favorite movie or novel, or use a published setting for \nthe D&amp;D game, you make that world your own over the \ncourse of a campaign. \nThe world where you set your campaign is one of \ncountless worlds that make up the D&amp;D multiverse, \na vast array of planes and worlds where adventures \nhappen. Even if you're using an established world such \nas the Forgotten Realms, your campaign takes place \nin a sort of mirror universe of the official setting where \nForgotten Realms novels, game products, and digital \ngames are assumed to take place. The world is yours to \nchange as you see fit and yours to modify as you explore \nthe consequences of the players' actions. \nYour world is more than just a backdrop for \nadventures. Like Middle Earth, Westeros, and countless \nother fantasy worlds out there, it's a place to which you \ncan escape and witness fantastic stories unfold. A well-\ndesigned and well-run world seems to flow around the \nadventurers, so that they feel part of something, instead \nof apart from it. \nConsistency is a key to a believable fictional \nworld. When the adventurers go back into town for \nsupplies, they should encounter the same nonplayer \ncharacters.(NPCs) they met before. Soon, they'll learn \nthe barkeep's name, and he or she will remember \ntheirs as well. Once you have achieved this degree of \nconsistency, you can provide an occasional change. If \nthe adventurers come back to buy more horses at the \nstables, they might discover that the man who ran the \nplace went back home to the large city over the hills, \nand now his niece runs the family business. That sort of · \nchange- one that has nothing to do with the adventurers \ndirectly, but one that they'll notice- makes the players \nfeel as though their characters are part of a living world \nthat changes and grows along with them. \nPart 1 of this book is all about inventing your world. \nChapter 1 asks what type of game you want to run, and \nhelps you nail down a few important details about your \nworld and its overarching conflicts. Chapter 2 helps you \nput your world in the greater context of the multiverse, \nexpanding on the information presented in the Player's \nHandbook to discuss the planes of existence and the \ngods and how you can put them together to serve the \nneeds of your campaign. \n"},

  'text': 'PART 2: MASTER OF ADVENTURES \nWhether you write your own adventures or use \npublished ones, expect to invest preparation time \nbeyond the hours you spend at the gaming table. You\'ll \nneed to carve out some free time to exercise your \ncreativity as you invent compelling plots, create new \nNPCs, craft encounters, and think of clever ways to \nforeshadow story events yet to come. \nPart 2 of this book is devoted to helping you create \nand run great adventures. Chapter 3 covers the basic \nelements of a D&amp;D adventure, and chapter 4 helps you \ncreate memorable NPCs. Chapter 5 presents guidelines \nand advice for running adventures set in dungeons, \nthe wilderness, and other locales, and chapter 6 covers \nthe time between adventures. Chapter 7 is all about \ntreasure, magic items, and special rewards that help \nkeep the players invested in your campaign. \nPART 3: MASTER OF RULES \nDUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS isn\'t a head-to-head competition, \nbut it needs someone who is impartial yet involved in the \ngame to guarantee that everyone at the table plays by the \nrules. As the player who creates the game world and the \nadventures that take place within it, the DM is a natural \nfit to take on the referee role. \n· \nAs a referee, the DM acts as a mediator between the \nrules and the players. A player tells the DM what he or \nshe wants to do, and the DM determines whether it is \nsuccessful or not, in some cases asking the player to \nmake a die roll to determine success. For example, if a \nplayer wants his or her character to take a swing at an \nore, you say, "Make an attack roll" while looking up the \nore\'s Armor Class. \nThe rules don\'t account for every possible situation \nthat might arise during a typical D&amp;D session. For \nexample, a player might want his or her character to \nhurl a brazier full of hot coals into a monster\'s face. \nHow you determine the outcome of this action is up to \nyou. You might tell the player to make a Strength check, \nwhile mentally setting the Difficulty Class (DC) at 15. \nIf the Strength check is successful, you then determine \nhow a face full of hot coals affects the monster. You \nmight decide that it deals ld4 fire damage and imposes \ndisadvantage on the monster\'s attack rolls until the end \nof its next turn. You roll the damage die (or let the player \ndo it), and the game continues. \nSometimes mediating the rules means setting limits. \nIf a player tells you, "I want to run up and attack the \nore," but the character doesn\'t have enough movement \nto reach the ore, you say, "It\'s too far away to move up \nand still attack. What would you like to do instead?" \nThe player takes the information and comes up with a \ndifferent plan. \nTo referee the rules, you need to know them. You don\'t \nhave to memorize this book or the Player\'s Handbook, \nbut you should have a clear idea of their contents so that, \nwhen a situation requires a ruling, you know where to \nfind the proper reference. \nThe Player\'s Handbook contains the main rules you \nneed to play the game. Part 3 of this book offers a wealth \nof information to help you adjudicate the rules in a wide \nvariety of situations. Chapter 8 presents advice for using \nattack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. It also \nincludes options appropriate for certain play styles and \ncampaigns, including guidelines for using miniatures, \na system for handling chase scenes, and rules for \nmadness. If you like to create your own stuff, such \nas new monsters, races, and character backgrounds, \nchapter 9 shows you how. That chapter also contains \noptional rules for unusual situations or play styles, such \nas the use of firearms in a fantasy setting. \nINTRODUCTION \n5 \n'},

  'text': 'OUR WORLD IS THE SETTING FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN, \nthe place where adventures happen. Even \nif you use an existing setting, such as the \nForgotten Realms, it becomes yours as you \nset your adventures there, create characters \nto inhabit it, and make changes to it over \nthe course of your campaign. This chapter is all about \nbuilding your world and then creating a campaign to \ntake place in it. \nTHE BIG PICTURE \nThis book, the Player\'s Handbook, and the Monster \nManual present the default assumptions for how the \nworlds of D&amp;D work. Among the established settings of \nD&amp;D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, \nand Mystara don\'t stray very far from those \nassumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, \nRaven loft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further \naway from that baseline. As you create your own world, \nit\'s up to you to decide where on the spectrum you want \nyour world to fall. \nCoRE AssuMPTIONS ______ _ \nThe rules of the game are based on the following core \nassumptions about the game world. \nGods Oversee the World. The gods are real and \nembody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming \ndominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, \nforests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world \nby granting divine magic to their followers and sending \nsigns and portents to guide them. The follower of a god \nserves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent \nseeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its \nrivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, \nnone can deny their existence. \nMuch of the World Is Untamed. Wild regions \nabound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms \nof various sizes dot the Ia ndscape, but beyond their \nborders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they \nlive in well. They\'ve heard stories of other places from \nmerchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond \nthe mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless \nthey\'ve been there themselves. \nThe World Is Ancient. Empires rise and fall, leaving \nfew places that have not been touched by imperial \ngrandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces \neventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with \nplaces of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations \nand their knowledge survive in legends, magic \nitems, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an \nempire\'s collapse. \nConflict Shapes the World\'s History. Powerful \nindividuals strive to make their mark on the world, and \nfactions of like-minded individuals can alter the course \nof history. Factions include religions led by charismatic \nprophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and \nshadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic. \nThe influence of such factions waxes and wanes as \nthey compete with each other for power. Some seek to \npreserve the world and usher in a golden age. Others \nstrive toward evil ends, seeking to rule the world with \nan iron fist. Still others seek goals that range from \nthe practical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation \nof material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god. \nWhatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide, \ncreating conflict that can steer the world\'s fate. \nThe World Is Magical. Practitioners of magic are \nrelatively few in number, but they leave evidence of \ntheir craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous \nand commonplace as a potion that heals wounds to \nsomething much more rare and impressive, such as a \nlevitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates \nof a city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches \nof magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as \nmagically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters \ncreated by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with \nmagical abilities. \nIT\'s YouR WoRLD _______ _ \nIn creating your campaign world, it helps to start with \nthe core assumptions and consider how your setting \nmight change them. The subsequent sections of this \nchapter address each element and give details on how to \nflesh out your world with gods, factions, and so forth. \nThe assumptions sketched out above aren\'t carved \nin stone. They inspire exciting D&amp;D worlds full of \nadventure, but they\'re not the only set of assumptions \nthat can do so. You can build an interesting campaign \nconcept by altering one or more of those core \nassumptions, just as well-established D&amp;D worlds have \ndone. Ask yourself, "What if the standard assumptions \nweren\'t true in my world?" \nThe World Is a Mundane Place. What if magic is rare \nand dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no \naccess to it? What if your campaign is set in a version of \nour own world\'s history? \nThe World Is New. What if your world is new, and \nthe characters are the first of a long line of heroes? \nThe adventurers might be champions of the first \ngreat empires, such as the empires of Netheril and \nCormanthor in the Forgotten Realms setting. \nThe World Is Known. What if the world is completely \ncharted and mapped, right down to the "Here there be \ndragons" notations? What if great empires cover huge \nstretches of countryside, with clearly defined borders \nbetween them? The Five Nations of the Eberron setting \nwere once part of a great empire, and magically aided \ntravel between its cities is commonplace. \nMonsters Are Uncommo"n. What if monsters are \nrare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft setting, horrific \ndomains are governed by monstrous rulers. The \npopulace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords \nand their evil minions, but other monsters rarely trouble \npeople\'s daily lives. \nMagic Is Everywhere. What if every town is ruled \nby a powerful wizard? What if magic item shops are \ncommon? The Eberron setting makes the use of magic \nCHAPTER 1 \\A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \n9 \n'},

What if the \ncharacters can challenge them and seize their power? \nOr what if the gods are remote, and even angels never \nmake contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun setting, the \ngods are extremely distant-perhaps nonexistent-and \nclerics rely instead on elemental power for their magic. \nGons OF YouR WoRLD \nAppendix B of the Player\'s Handbook presents a \nnumber of pantheons (loose groupings of deities not \nunited by a single doctrine or philosophy) for use in your \ngame, including the gods of established D&amp;D worlds \nand fantasy-historical pantheons. You can adopt one of \nthese pantheons for your campaign, or pick and choose \ndeities and ideas from them as you please. See "A \nSample Pantheon" in this section for an example. \nAs far as the game\'s rules are concerned, it doesn\'t \nmatter if your world has hundreds of deities or a church \ndevoted to a single god. In rules terms, clerics choose \ndomains, not deities, so your world can associate \ndomains with deities in any way you choose. \nLOOSE PANTHEONS \nMost D&amp;D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods. \nA multitude of deities rule the various aspects of \nexistence, variously cooperating with and competing \nagainst one another to administer the affairs of the \nuniverse. People gather in public shrines to worship \ngods of life and wisdom, or meet in hidden places to \nvenerate gods of deception or destruction. \nEach deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is \nresponsible for advancing that portfolio.

Even in the midst of his \neverlasting war with his brother Hextor, god of war and \ntyranny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: war \nfought nobly and in the cause of justice. \nPeople in most D&amp;D worlds are polytheistic, honoring \ndeities of their own and acknowledging pantheons of \nother cultures. Individuals pay homage to various gods, \nregardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a \nperson might propitiate Umberlee before setting out \nto sea, join a communal feast to celebrate Chauntea at \nharvest time, and pray to Malar before going hunting. \nSome individuals feel a calling to a particular deity\'s \nservice and claim that god as a patron. Particularly \ndevoted individuals become priests by setting up a \nshrine or helping to staff a holy site. Much more rarely, \nthose who feel such a calling become clerics or paladins \ninvested with the responsibility of true divine power. \nShrines and temples serve as community gathering \npoints for religious rites and festivals. Priests at such \nsites relate stories of the gods, teach the ethics of their \npatron deities, offer advice and blessings, perform \nreligious rites, and provide training in activities their \ndeities favor. Cities and large towns can host several \ntemples dedicated to individual gods important to the \ncommunity, while smaller settlements might have a \nsingle shrine devoted to any gods the locals revere. \nTo quickly build a pantheon for your world, crea~e \na single god for each of the eight domains available \nto clerics: Death, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, \nTempest, Trickery, and War. You can invent names \nand personalities for these deities, or borrow deities \nfrom other pantheons. This approach gives you a small \npantheon that covers the most significant aspects of \nexistence, and it\'s easy enough to extrapolate other \nareas of life each deity controls.

  'text': 'for example, might also be patron of magic and \nprophecy, while the god of Light could be the sun god \nand the god of time. \nA SAMPLE PANTHEON \nThe pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a \npantheon assembled from mostly preexisting elements \nto suit the needs of a particular campaign. This is \nthe default pantheon in the fourth edition Player\'s \nHandbook (2008). The pantheon is summarized in the \nDawn War Deities table. \nThis pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities \nand establishes them as universal gods. These gods \ninclude Bahamut, Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth, Moradin, \nSehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and \nCorell on as gods of their respective portfolios, rather \nthan as racial deities. The pantheon also includes the \narchdevil Asmodeus as god of domination and tyranny. \nSeveral of the gods are drawn from other pantheons, \nsometimes with new names for the gods. Bane comes \nfrom the Forgotten Realms. From Greyhawk come \nKord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the Greek \npantheon come Athena (renamed Era this) and Tyche \n(renamed Avandra), though both are altered. Set \n(renamed Zehir) comes from the Egyptian pantheon. \nThe Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon\'s He! \nand Greyhawk\'s Weejas. That leaves three gods created \nfrom scratch: Ioun, Melora, and Torog: \nOTHER RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS \nIn your campaign, you can create pantheons of gods \nwho are closely linked in a single religion, monotheistic \nreligions (worship of a single deity), dualistic systems \n(centered on two opposing deities or forces), mystery \ncults (involving personal devotion to a single deity, \nusually as part of a pantheon system), anjmistic \nreligions (revering the spirits inherent in nature), or \neven forces and philosophies that don\'t center on deities. \nTIGHT PANTHEONS \nIn contrast to a loose pantheon, a tight pantheon focuses \non a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace \na small group of deities. Followers of a tight pantheon \nmight favor one of its member deities over another, \nbut they respect all the deities and honor them with \nsacrifices and prayer as appropriate. \nThe key trait to a tight pantheon is that its worshipers \nembrace a single ethos or dogma that includes all the \ndeities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to \nprotect and guide their followers. You can think of a \ntight pantheon as similar to a family. One or two deities \nwho lead the pantheon serve as parent figures, with \nthe rest serving as patrons of important aspects of the \nculture that worships the pantheon. A single temple \nhonors all members of the pantheon. \nMost tight pantheons have one or more aberrant \ngods-deities whose worship isn\'t sanctioned by the \npriests of the pantheon as a whole. These are usually \nevil deities and enemies of the pantheon, such as the \nGreek Titans. These deities have cults of their own, \nattracting social outcasts and villains to their worship. \nThese cults resemble mystery cults, their members \nstrictly devoted to their single god, though even \nmembers of aberrant cults pay lip service in the temples \nof the tight pantheon. \nThe Norse deities serve as an example of a tight \npantheon. Odin is the pantheon\'s leader and father \nfigure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr, and Freya embody \nimportant aspects of Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki \nand his devotees lurk in the shadows, sometimes aiding \nthe other deities, and sometimes working against them \nwith the pantheon\'s enemies. \nMYSTERY CULTS \nA mystery cult is a secretive religious organization \nbased on a ritual of initiation, in which the initiate is \nmystically identified with a god, or a handful of related \ngods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, concerned \nwith the initiate\'s relationship with the divine. \nSometimes a mystery cult is a type of worship within \na pantheon. It acknowledges the myths and rituals of \nthe pantheon, but presents its own myths and rites as \nprimary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might \nimmerse themselves in a mystical relationship to a god \nwho is part of a broadly worshiped pantheon. \nA mystery cult emphasizes the history of its god, \nwhich is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual. \nThe foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple \nand often involves a god\'s death and rising, or a journey \nto the underworld and a return. Mystery cults often \nrevere sun and moon deities and agricultural deities-\ngods whose portfolios reflect the cycles of nature. \nDIVINE RANK \nThe divine beings of the multiverse are often categorized \naccording to their cosmic power. Some gods are worshiped \non multiple worlds and have a different rank on each world, \ndepending on their influence there. \nGreater deities are beyond mortal understanding. They \ncan\'t be summoned, and they are almost always removed \nfrom direct involvement in mortal affairs. On very rare \noccasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities, but \nslaying a greater god\'s avatar has no effect on the god itself. \nLesser deities are embodied somewhere in the planes. \nSome lesser deities live in the Material Plane, as does the \nunicorn-goddess Lurue of the Forgotten Realms and the \ntitanic shark-god Sekolah revered by the sahuagin. Others \nlive on the Outer Planes, as Lolth does in the Abyss. Such \ndeities can be encountered by mortals. \nQuasi-deities have a divine origin, but they don\'t hear or \nanswer prayers, grant spells to clerics, or control aspects of \nmortal life. They are still immensely powerful beings, and in \ntheory they could ascend to godhood if they amassed enough \nworshipers. Quasi-deities fall into three subcategories: \ndemigods, titans, and vestiges. \nDemigods are born from the union of a deity and a mortal \nbeing. They have some divine attributes, but their mortal \nparentage makes them the weakest quasi-deities. \nTitans are the divine creations of deities. They might be \nbirthed from the union of two deities, manufactured on \na divine forge, born from the blood spilled by a god, or \notherwise brought about through divine will or substance. \nVestiges are deities who have lost nearly all their worshipers \nand are considered dead, from a mortal perspective. Esoteric \nrituals can sometimes contact these beings and draw on \ntheir latent power. \n"""\' \nCHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \nTI \n'},

  'text': "12 \nThe cult's ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its \nfoundation myth. Neophytes retrace the god's footsteps \nin order to share the god's ultimate fate. In the case of \ndying and rising gods, the symbolic death of the initiate \nrepresents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth \ninto a transformed existence. Initiates are born into \na new life, remaining in the world of mortal affairs \nbut feeling elevated to a higher sphere. The initiate is \npromised a place in the god's realm after death, but also \nexperiences new meaning in life. \nMONOTHEISM \nMonotheistic religions revere only one deity, and in \nsome cases, deny the existence of any other deity. If you \nintroduce a monotheistic religion into your campaign, \nyou need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if \nthey don't, other religions can exist side by side with \nthe monotheistic religion. If these religions have clerics \nwith spellcasting ability, their spells might be powered \nby the one true deity, by lesser spirits who aren't deities \n(possibly including powerful aberrations, celestials, fey, \nfiends, or elementals), or simply by their faith. \nThe deity of a monotheistic religion has an extensive \nportfolio and is portrayed as the creator of everything, in \ncontrol of everything, and concerned with every aspect \nof existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers prayers \nand sacrifices to the same god regardless of what \naspect of life is in need of divine assistance. Whether \nmarching into war, setting off on a journey, or hoping \nto win someone's affections, the worshiper prays to \nthe same god. \nSome monotheistic religions describe different \naspects of their deity. A single god appears in different \naspects as the Creator and the Destroyer, and the clerics \nof that god focus on one aspect or the other, determining \ntheir domain access and possibly even their alignment \non that basis. A cleric who venerates the Destroyer \naspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while \none who worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life \nor Nature domains. In some monotheistic religions, \nclerics group themselves into distinct religious orders to \ndifferentiate clerics who choose different domains. \nDUALISM \nA dualistic religion views the world as the stage for \na conflict between two diametrically opposed deities \nor divine forces. Most often, the opposed forces are \ngood and evil, or opposed deities representing those \nforces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law \nand chaos are the fundamental opposites in a dualistic \nsystem. Life and death, light and darkness, rna ter and \nspirit, body and mind, health and illness, purity and \ndefilement, positive energy and negative energy-the \nD&amp;D universe is full of polar opposites that could serve \nas the foundation for a dualistic religion. Whatever the \nterms in which the dualism is expressed, half of the pair \nis usually believed to be good- beneficial, desirable, \nor holy-while the other half is considered bad, if not \nexplicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is \nexpressed as the opposition between matter and spirit, \nthe followers of that religion believe that one of the two \n(usually matter) is evil and the other (spirit) is good, and \nCHAPTER I j A WORLD Of YOUR OWN \nso seek to liberate their spirits from this material world \nand its evils through asceticism and contemplation. \nRare dualistic systems believe that the two opposing \nforces must remain in balance, always pulling away \nfrom each other but remaining bound together in \ncreative tension. \nIn a cosmology defined by an eternal conflict between \ngood and evil, mortals are expected to take sides. The \nmajority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship \nthe deity or force identified as good. Worshipers of \nthe good deity trust themselves to that god's power to \nprotect them from the evil deity's minions. Because \nthe evil deity in such a religion is usually the source \nof everything that is detrimental to existence, only the \nperverse and depraved worship this god. Monsters \nand fiends serve it, as do certain secretive cults. The \nmyths of a dualistic religion usually predict that the \ngood deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the \nforces of evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn't \npredetermined and work to promote their deity's victory. \nDeities in a dualistic system maintain large portfolios. \nAll aspects of existence reflect the dualistic struggle, \nand therefore all things can fall on one side or the other \nof the conflict. Agriculture, mercy, the sky, medicine, \nand poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and \nfamine, hatred, disease, and war belong to the evil deity. \nANIMISM \nAnimism is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of \nthe natural world. In an animistic worldview, everything \nhas a spirit, from the grandest mountain to the lowliest \nrock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook, from the \nsun and moon to a fighter's ancestral sword. All these \nobjects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient, \nthough some are more aware, alert, and intelligent \nthan others. The most powerful spirits might even \nbe considered deities. All are worthy of respect if not \nveneration. \nAnimists don't typically pay allegiance to one spirit \nover the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices \nto different spirits at different times, as appropriate \nto the situation. A pious character might make daily \nprayers and offerings to ancestor spirits and the spirits \nof the house, regular petitions to important spirits \nsuch as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional \nsacrifices of incense to location spirits such as the \nspirit of a forest, and sporadic prayers to a host of other \nspirits as well. \nAn animistic religion very tolerant. Most spirits don't \ncare to whom a character also offers sacrifices, as long \nas they receive the sacrifices and respect they are due. \nAs new religions spread through animist lands, those \nreligions typically win adherents but not converts. \nPeople incorporate new spirits and deities into their \nprayers without displacing the old ones. Contemplatives \nand scholars adopt complex philosophical systems and \npractices without changing their belief in and respect \nfor the spirits they already venerate. \nAnimism functions as a large tight pantheon. Animist \nclerics serve the pantheon as a whole, and so can \nchoose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for \nthat cleric. \n"},

  'text': "FORCES AND PHILOSOPHIES \nNot all divine powers need to be derived from deities. \nIn some campaigns, believers hold enough conviction \nin their ideas about the universe that they gain magical ·, · \npower from that conviction. In other campaigns, \n' \nimpersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods \nby granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as \ndruids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the \nforce of nature rather than from a specific nature deity, \nsome clerics devote themselves to ideals rather than to \na god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and \nchivalry rather than a specific deity. \nForces and philosophies aren't worshiped; they aren't \nbeings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept \nsacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn't \nnecessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can \nbe devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship \nto various good deities, or revere the force of nature \nand also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might \nbe seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal \nforce. In a world that includes deities with demonstrable \npower (through their clerics), it's unusual for a \nphilosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a \ncommon philosophical belief states that the deities are \nmore like mortals than they would have mortals believe. \nAccording to such philosophies, the gods aren't truly \nimmortal (just very long-lived), and mortals can attain \ndivinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the ultimate \ngoal of some philosophies. \n. \nThe power of a philosophy stems from the belief that \nmortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person \nbelieves in isn't strong enough to bestow magical power \non that person. \nHUMANOIDS AND THE GODS \nWhen it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider \nrange of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In \nmany D&amp;D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves, goblins, and \nother humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected \nthat an ore will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of \nsubordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces \na staggering variety of deities. Each human culture \nmight have its own array of gods. \nIn most D&amp;D settings, there is no single god that \ncan claim to have created humanity. Thus, the human \nproclivity for building institutions extends to religion. \nA single charismatic prophet can convert an entire \nkingdom to the worship of a new god. With that \nprophet's death, the religion might wax or wane, or the \nprophet's followers might turn against one another and \nfound several competing religions. \nIn comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in \nstone. The dwarves of the Forgotten Realms identify \nMoradin as their creator. While individual dwarves \nmight follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are \npledged to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His \nteachings and magic are so thoroughly ingrained in \ndwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic shift to \nreplace him. \nWith that in mind, consider the role of the gods in \nyour world and their ties to different humanoid races. \n· Does each race have a creator god? How does that god \n• \nshape that race's culture? Are other folk free of such \ndivine ties and free to worship as they wish? Has a race \nturned against the god that created it? Has a new race \nappeared, created by a god within the past few years? \nA deity might also have ties to a kingdom, noble \nline, or other cultural institution. With the death of \nthe emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine \nportents sent by the deity who protected the empire in \nits earliest days. In such a land, the worship of other \ngods might be outlawed or tightly controlled. \nFinally, consider the difference between gods who \nare tied to specific humanoid races and gods with \nmore diverse followers. Do the races with their own \npantheons enjoy a place of privilege in your world, with \ntheir gods taking an active role in their affairs? Are the \nother races ignored by the gods, or are those races the \ndeciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor \nof one god or another? \nCHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \n!3 \n"},

  'text': 'I4 \nMAPPING YouR CAMPAIGN \nWhen creating the world where your campaign takes \nplace, you\'ll want a map. You can take one of two \napproaches with it: top-down or bottom-up. Some DMs \nlike to start at the top, creating the big picture of the \nworld at the start of the campaign by having a map \nthat shows whole continents, and then zooming in on \nsmaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the opposite \ndirection, starting with a small campaign area that is \nmapped at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming \nout as adventures take the characters into new territory. \nWhichever approach you take, hexes work well for \nmapping outdoor environments where travel can go \nin any direction and calculating distance might be \nimportant. A single sheet of hex paper with 5 hexes to \nthe inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale for your map \nthat\'s best suited to the level of detail you want. Chapter \n7 offers more information about creating and mapping \nwilderness areas. \nPROVINCE SCALE \nFor the most detailed areas of your world, use a \nprovince scale where each hex represents 1 mile. A \nfull-page map at this scale represents an area that \ncan be covered in one day\'s travel in any direction \nfrom the center of the map, assuming clear terrain. As \nsuch, province scale is a useful scale for mapping a \ncampaign\'s starting area (see "Creating a Campaign," \nlater in this chapter) or any location where you expect \nto track the adventurers\' movement in hours rather \nthan days. \n• \nThe ground cover of an area this size will include \nbroad stretches of one predominant terrain type, broken \nup by other isolated terrain types. \nA settled region mapped at this scale might have one \ntown and eight to twelve villages or farming hamlets. \nA wilder region might have only a single keep, or no \nsettlements at all. You can also indicate the extent of \nthe cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town. \nOn a province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few \nhexes wide surrounding each town or village. Even \nsmall villages farm most of the arable land within a \nmile or two. \nCHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \nKINGDOM SCALE \nOn a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles. \nA map at this scale covers a large region, about the size \nof Great Britain or half the size of the state of California. \nThat\'s plenty of room for adventuring. \nThe first step of mapping a region at this scale is to \nsketch out the coastlines and any major bodies of water \nin the area. Is the region landlocked or on a coast? A \ncoastal region might include islands offshore, and a \nlandlocked area might include an inland sea or major \nlakes. Alternatively, the region could consist of a single \nlarge island, or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple \ncoastlines. \nNext, sketch in any major mountain ranges. Foothills \nform a transition between the mountains and lowlands, \nand broad patches of gentle hills might dot the region. \nThat leaves the rest of your map for relatively fiat \nterrain: grasslands, forests, swamps, and the like. Place \nthese elements as you see fit. \nMap out the courses of any rivers that flow through \nthe area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas \nthat see a lot of rainfall, winding down to the nearest \nmajor body of water that doesn\'t require the river to \ncross over higher elevation. Tributaries join rivers as \nthey grow larger and move toward a lake or the sea. \nFinally, place the major towns and cities of the region. \nAt this scale, you don\'t need to worry about small towns \nand villages, or about mapping every belt of farmland. \nEven so, a settled region this size might easily have \neight to twelve cities or towns to put on the map. \nCONTINENT SCALE \nFor mapping a whole continent, use a scale where \n1 hex represents 60 miles. At this scale, you can\'t \nsee more than the shape of coastlines, the biggest \nmountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political \nboundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how \nmultiple kingdom-scale maps fit together, rather than \ntracking the movement of adventurers day by day. \nThe same process you use for mapping a region at \nkingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent. \nA continent might have eight to twelve large cities that \ndeserve a place on the map, most likely major trade \ncenters and the capitals of kingdoms. \nCOMBINING SCALES \n--~--------------\nWhichever scale you start with, it\'s easy to zoom in or \nout on your maps. At continent scale, 1 hex represents \nthe same area as 10 kingdom-scale hexes. Two cities \nthat are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent \nmap would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map, \nand might define the opposite ends of the region you\'re \ndetailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex equals 6 province-\nscale hexes, so it\'s easy to put the region covered by your \nprovince-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale \nmap and create interesting areas around it. \n'},

  'text': 'SETTLEMENTS \nThe places where people live-bustling cities, \nprosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among \nmiles of farmland- help define the nature of civilization \nin your world. A single settlement- a home base for \nyour adventurers- is a great place to start a campaign \nand begin your world building. Consider the following \nquestions as you create any settlement in your world: \nWhat purpose does it serve in your game? \nHow big is it? Who lives there? \nWhat does it look, smell, a-nd sound like? \nWho governs it? Who else holds power? Is it part \nof a larger state? \nWhat are its defenses? \n• Where do characters go to find the goods and services \nthey need? \n• What temples and other organizations feature \nprominently? \n• What fantastic elements distinguish it from an \nordinary town? \nWhy should the characters care about the settlement? \nThe guidelines in this section are here to help you build \nthe settlement you want for whatever purpose you have \nin mind. Disregard any advice here that runs counter to \nyour vision for a settlement. \nPURPOSE \nA settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story \nand fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the \nsettlement\'s purpose determines the amount of detail \nyou put into it. Create only the features of a settlement \nthat you know you\'ll need, along with notes on general \nfeatures. Then allow the place to grow organically as the \nadventurers interact with more and more of it, keeping \nnotes on new places you invent. \nLOCAL COLOR \nA settlement might serve as a place where the \ncharacters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement \nof this sort needs no more than a brief description. \nInclude the settlement\'s name, decide how big it is, \nadd a dash of flavor ("The smell of the local tanneries \nnever lifts from this town"), and let the adventurers get \non with their business. The history of the inn where \nthe characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the \nshopkeeper they buy supplies from-you can add this \nlevel of detail, but you don\'t have to. If the characters \nreturn to the same settlement, start adding these local \nfeatures so that it begins to feel a little more like a home \nbase, albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop \nas the need arises. \nHOME BASE \nA settlement gives the adventurers a place to live, \ntrain, and recuperate between adventures. An entire \ncampaign can center on a particular town or city. \nSuch a settlement is the launching pad from which the \ncharacters go out into the wider world. \nDesigned well, a home base can hold a special place \nin the adventurers\' hearts, particularly if they care about \none or more NPCs who live there. \n'},

  'text': "To make a home base come alive, you'll need to \ninvest some time fleshing out details, but the players \ncan help you with that work. Ask them to tell you a bit \nabout mentors, family members, and other important \npeople in their characters' lives. Feel free to add to and \nmodify what they give you, but you'll start with a solid \nfoundation of the non player characters (NPCs) who are \nimportant to the characters. Let the players describe \nwhere and how their characters spend their time- a \nfavorite tavern, library, or temple, perhaps. \nUsing these NPCs and locations as a starting point, \nflesh out the settlement's cast of characters. Detail \nits leadership, including law enforcement (discussed \nlater in the chapter). Include characters who can \nprovide information, such as sages, soothsayers, \nlibrarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can \nprovide spellcasting as well as information. Make note \nof merchants who might regularly interact with the \nadventurers and perhaps compete with one another for \nthe party's business. Think about the people who run \nthe adventurers' favorite tavern. And then add a handful \nof wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired \nmercenary, a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a \ndash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign. \nADVENTURE SITE \nA village harboring a secret cult of devil worshipers. A \ntown controlled by a guild of wererats. A city conquered \nby a hobgoblin army. These settlements aren't merely \nrest stops but locations where adventures unfold. In \na settlement that doubles as an adventure location, \ndetail the intended adventure areas, such as towers \nand warehouses. For an event-based adventure, note \nthe NPCs who play a part in the adventure. This \nwork is adventure preparation as much as it is world \nbuilding, and the cast of characters you develop for \nyour adventure-including allies, patrons, enemies, and \nextras- can become recurring figures in your campaign. \nSIZE \nMost settlements in a D&amp;D world are villages clustered \naround a larger town or city. Farming villages supply the \ntown or city population with food in exchange for goods \nthe farmers can't produce themselves. Towns and cities \nare the seats of the nobles who govern the surrounding \narea, and who carry the responsibility for defending the \nvillages from attack.

  'text': "_ lost settlements are agricultural villages, supporting \nthemselves and nearby towns or cities with crops and \nmeat. Villagers produce food in one way or another-if \nnot by tending the crops, then supporting those who do \nby shoeing horses, weaving clothes, milling grain, and \nthe like. The goods they produce feed their families and \nupply trade with nearby settlements. \nA village's population is dispersed around a large area \nof land. Farmers live on their land, which spreads them \nvidely around the village center. At the heart of the \n\\·illage, a handful of structures cluster together: a well, \na marketplace, a small temple or two, a gathering place, \nand perhaps an inn for travelers. \nTowN \nPopulation: Up to about 6,000 \nGovernment: A resident noble rules and appoints a lord \nmayor to oversee administration. An elected town \ncouncil represents the interests of the middle class. \nDefense: The noble commands a sizable army of \nprofessional soldiers, as well as personal bodyguards. \nCommerce: Basic supplies are readily available, though \nexotic goods and services are harde·r to find. Inns and \ntaverns support travelers. \nOrganizations: The town contains several temples, \nas well as various merchant guilds and other \norganizations. \nTowns are major trade centers, situated where important \nindustries and reliable trade routes enabled the \npopulation to grow. These settlements rely on commerce: \n!.he import of raw materials and food from surrounding \n·illages, and the export of crafted items to those villages, \nas well as to other towns and cities. A town's population \ni more diverse than that of most villages. \nTowns arise where roads intersect waterways, at the \nmeeting of major land trade routes, around strategic \ndefensive locations, or near significant mines or similar \nnatural resources. \nC ITY \nPopulation: Up to about 25,000 \nGovernment: A resident noble presides, with several \nother nobles sharing responsibility for surrounding \nareas and government functions. One such noble is \nthe lord mayor, who oversees the city administration. \nAn elected city council represents the middle class \nand might hold more actual power than the lord \nmayor. Other groups serve as important power \ncenters as well. \nDefense: The city supports an army of professional \nsoldiers, guards, and town watch. Each noble in \nresidence maintains a small force of personal \nbodyguards. \nCommerce: Almost any goods or services are readily \navailable. Many inns and taverns support travelers. \nOrganizations: A multitude of temples, guilds, and \nother organizations, some of which hold significant \npower in city affairs, can be found within the \ncity's walls. \nCities are cradles of civilization. Their larger \npopulations require considerable support from both \nurrounding villages and trade routes, so they're rare. \nCities typically thrive in areas where large expanses \nof fertile, arable land surround a location accessible to \ntrade, almost always on a navigable waterway. \nCities almost always have walls, and the stages of a \ncity's growth are easily identified by the expansion of \nthe walls beyond the central core. These internal walls \nnaturally divide the city into wards (neighborhoods \ndefined by specific features), which have their own \nrepresentatives on the city council and their own noble \nadministrators. \nCities that hold more than twenty-five thousand people \nare extremely rare. Metropolises such as Waterdeep in \nthe Forgotten Realms, Sharn in Eberron, and the Free \nCity of Greyhawk stand as vital beacons of civilization in \nthe D&amp;D worlds. \nATMOSPHERE \n-------\nWhat do the adventurers first notice as they approach \nor enter a settlement? The towering wall bristling \nwith soldiers? The beggars with hands outstretched, \npleading for aid outside the gate? The noisy hubbub of \nmerchants and buyers thronging the market square? \nThe overpowering stench of manure? \nSensory details help bring a settlement to life and \nvividly communicate its personality to your players. \nSettle on a single defining factor that sums up a \nsettlement's personality and extrapolate from there. \nMaybe a city is built around canals, like real-world \nVenice. That key element suggests a wealth of sensory \ndetails: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy \nwaters, the sound of lapping waves and perhaps singing \ngondoliers, the smells of fish and waste polluting \nthe water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is \nshrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the \ntendrils of cold mist reaching through every crack and \ncranny, the muffled sounds of hooves on cobblestones, \nthe cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense of \nmystery and lurking danger. \nThe climate and terrain of a settlement's environment, \nits origin and inhabitants, its government and political \nposition, and its commercial importance all have a \nbearing on its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against \nthe edge of a jungle has a very different feel than one \non the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf cities present \na distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to \nhuman-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell \nany hint of dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city \nfostering an early system of democracy might boast an \nopen-air market where philosophical ideas are traded as \nfreely as produce. All the possible combinations of these \nfactors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of \nyour campaign world. \nGOVERNMENT \nIn the feudal society common in most D&amp;D worlds, \npower and authority are concentrated in towns and \ncities. Nobles hold authority over the settlements \nwhere they live and the surrounding lands. They collect \ntaxes from the populace, which they use for public \nbuilding projects, to pay the soldiery, and to support a \ncomfortable lifestyle for themselves (although nobles \nCHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \n"},

In exchange, \nthey promise to protect their citizens from threats \nsuch as ore marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving \nhuman bandits. \nNobles appoint officers as their agents in villages, to \nsupervise the collection of taxes and serve as judges \nin disputes and criminal trials. These reeves, sheriffs, \nor bailiffs are commoners native to the villages they \ngovern, chosen for their positions because they already \nhold the respect of their fellow citizens. \nWithin towns and cities, lords share authority and \nadministrative responsibility with lesser nobles (usually \ntheir own relatives), and also with representatives of \nthe middle class, such as traders and artisans. A lord \nmayor of noble birth is appointed to head the town or \ncity council and to perform the same administrative \nfunctions that reeves carry out in villages. The council \nconsists of representatives elected by the middle class. \nOnly foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their councils, \nsince the economic power of the middle class is often \nmore important to the prosperity of a town or city than \nthe hereditary authority of the nobility. \nThe larger a settlement, the more likely that other \nindividuals or organizations hold significant power \nthere as well. Even in a village, a popular individual-a \nwise elder or a well-liked farmer-can wield more \ninfluence than the appointed reeve, and a wise reeve \navoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns \nand cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a \nprominent temple, a guild independent of the council, or \nan individual with magical power. \nFORMS OF GOVERNMENT \nA settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city \nmight be a theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city \ngoverned by a merchant council. More likely, it's part of \na feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic empire, or a remote \nrealm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how your \nsettlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or \nregion-who rules its ruler, and what other settlements \nmight also lie under its control. \nFORMS OF GOVERNMENT \ndlOO \nGovernment \ndlOO \nGovernment \n01-08 \nAutocracy \n59-64 \nMilitocracy \n09-13 \nBureaucracy \n65-74 \nMonarchy \n14-19 \nConfederacy \n75-78 \nOligarchy \n20-22 \nDemocracy \n79-80 \nPatriarchy \n23-27 \nDictatorship \n81-83 \nMeritocracy \n28-42 \nFeudalism \n84-85 \nPlutocracy \n43-44 \nGerontocracy \n86-92 \nRepublic \n45-53 \nHierarchy \n93-94 \nSatrapy \n54-56 \nMagocracy \n95 \nKleptocracy \n57-58 \nMatriarchy \n96-00 \nTheocracy \nTypical and fantastical forms of government are \ndescribed below. Choose one or randomly determine a \nform of government for a nation or city from the Forms \nof Government table. \nCHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \nAutocracy. One hereditary ruler wields absolute \npower. The autocrat either is supported by a well-\ndeveloped bureaucracy or military or stands as the \nonly authority in an otherwise anarchic society. The \ndynastic ruler could be immortal or undead. Aundair \nand Karrnath, two kingdoms in the Eberron campaign \nsetting, have autocrats with royal blood in their veins. \nWhereas Queen Aurala of Aundair relies on wizar.ds \nand spies to enforce her will, Kaius, the vampire king of \nKarrnath, has a formidable army of living and undead \nsoldiers under his command. \nBureaucracy. Various departments compose the \ngovernment, each responsible for an aspect of rule. The \ndepartment heads, ministers, or secretaries answer to a \nfigurehead autocrat or council. \nConfederacy. Each individual city or town within \nthe confederacy governs itself, but all contribute to a \nleague or federation that promotes (at least in theory) \nthe common good of all member states. Conditions and \nattitudes toward the central government vary from place \nto place within the confederacy. The Lords' Alliance in \nthe Forgotten Realms setting is a loose confederacy of \ncities, while the Mror Holds in the Eberron campaign \nsetting is a confederacy of allied dwarf clans. \nDemocracy. Citizens or their elected representatives \ndetermine the laws in a democracy. A bureaucracy or \nmilitary carries out the day-to-day work of government, \nwith positions filled through open elections. \nDictatorship. One supreme ruler holds absolute \nauthority, but his or her rule isn't necessarily dynastic. \nIn other respects this resembles an autocracy. In the \nGreyhawk campaign setting, a half-demon named Iuz is \nthe dictator of a conquered land that bears his name. \nFeudalism. The typical government of Europe in \nthe Middle Ages, a feudalistic society consists of layers \nof lords and vassals. The vassals provide soldiers or \nscutage (payment in lieu of military service) to the lords, \nwho in turn promise protection to their vassals. \nGerontocracy. Elders preside over this society. In \nsome cases, long-lived races such as elves or dragons \nare entrusted with the leadership of the land. \nHierarchy. A feudal or bureaucratic government \nwhere every member, except one, is subordinate to \nanother member. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, \nthe dragonarmies of Krynn form a military hierarchy, \nwith the Dragon Highlords as leaders under the dragon \nqueen Takhisis. \nKleptocracy. This government is composed of groups \nor individuals primarily seeking wealth for themselves, \noften at the expense of their subjects. The grasping \nBandit Kingdoms in the Grey hawk campaign setting \nare prime examples. A kingdom run by thieves' guilds \nwould also fall into this category. \nMagocracy. The governing body is composed of \nspellcasters who rule directly as oligarchs or feudal \nlords, or participate in a democracy or bureaucracy. \nExamples include the Red Wizards of Thay in the \nForgotten Realms campaign setting and the sorcerer-\nkings of Athas in the Dark Sun campaign setting. \nMatriarchy or Patriarchy. This society is governed \nby the eldest or most important members of one gender. \nDraw cities are examples of theocratic matriarchies, for \n"},

In the \nForgotten Realms, scholarly monks preside over the \nfortress-library of Candlekeep, overseen by a master of \nlore called the Keeper. \nMilitocracy. Military leaders run the nation under \nmartial law, using the army and other armed forces.

A single hereditary sovereign wears the \ncrown. Unlike the autocrat, the monarch\'s powers are \nlimited by law, and the ruler serves as the head of a \ndemocracy, feudal state, or militocracy. The kingdom \nof Breland, in the Eberron campaign setting, has both \na parliament that makes laws and a monarch who \nenforces them. \nOligarchy. A small number of absolute rulers share \npower, possibly dividing the land into districts or \nprovinces under their control, or jointly ruling together. \n_.\\group of adventurers who take control of a nation \ntogether might form an oligarchy. The Free City of \nGreyhawk is an oligarchy composed of various faction \nleaders, with a Lord Mayor as its figurehead. \nPlutocracy. Society is governed by the wealthy. The \nelite form a ruling council, purchase representati"on at \nrhe court of a figurehead monarch, or rule by default \nbecause money is the true power in the realm. Many \ncities in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, \nincluding Waterdeep and Baldur\'s Gate, are plutocracies. \nRepublic. Government is entrusted to representatives \nof an established electorate who rule on behalf of the \nelectors. Any democracy in which only landowners or \ncertain classes can vote could be considered a republic. \nSatrapy. Conquerors and representatives of another \ngovernment wield power, ruling the settlement or region \nas part of a larger empire. The satraps are bureaucrats \nand military officers, or unusual characters or monsters. \nThe cities of High port and Suder ham in the Greyhawk \ncampaign setting are satrapies controlled by agents of a \n,·icious gang of marauders known as the Slave Lords. \nTheocracy. Rulership falls to a direct representative \nor a collection of agents of a deity. The centers of power \nin a theocracy are usually located on sacred sites. In \nthe Eberron campaign setting, the nation of Thrane is \na theocracy devoted to the Silver Flame, a divine spirit \nthat resides in Thrane\'s capital of Flamekeep. \nSAMPLE HIERARCHY oF NoBLE TITLES \nRank \nTitle \nRank \nTitle \n1st \nEmperor/Empress \n7th \nViscount/ \n2nd \nKing/Queen \nViscountess \n3rd \nDuke/Duchess \n8th \nBaron/Baroness \n4th \nPrince/Princess \n9th \nBaronet \n5th \nMarquess/Marquise \nlOth \nKnight \n6th \nEarl or Count/ \nCountess \nCOMMERCE \nEven small villages can provide characters access to the \ngear they need to pursue their adventures. Provisions, \ntents, backpacks, and simple weapons are commonly \navailable. Traveling merchants carry armor, martial \nweapons, and more specialized gear. Most villages have \ninns that cater to travelers, where adventurers can find \na hot meal and a bed, even if the quality leaves much to \nbe desired. \nVillages rely heavily on trade with other settlements, \nincluding larger towns and cities. Merchants pass \nthrough regularly, selling necessities and luxuries to the \nvil,Iagers, and any successful merchant has far-reaching \ncontacts across the region. Traveling merchants pass \non gossip and adventure hooks to the characters as \nthey conduct their business. Since merchants make \ntheir living traversing roads that might be menaced \nby bandits or wandering monsters, they hire guards to \nkeep their goods safe. They also carry news from town \nto town, including reports of situations that cry out for \nthe attention of adventurers. \nThese merchants can\'t provide the services normally \nfound in a city. For instance, when the characters are in \nneed of a library or a dedicated sage, a trainer who can \nhandle the griffon eggs they\'ve found, or an architect to \ndesign their castle, they\'re better off going to a large city \nthan looking in a village. \nCURRENCY \nThe straightforward terms "gold piece" (gp), "silver \npiece" (sp), "copper piece" (cp), "electrum piece" (ep), \nand "platinum piece" (pp) are used throughout the game \nrules for clarity. You can imbue these denominations \nwith more interesting descriptions in your game \nworld. People give coins specific names, whether \nas plain as "dime" or lively as "gold double-eagle." A \ncountry typically mints its own currency, which might \ncorrespond to the basic rules terms. In most worlds, few \ncurrencies achieve widespread distribution, but nearly \nall coins are accepted worldwide-except by those \nlooking to pick a fight with a foreigner. \nExAMPLE: THE FoRGOTTEN REALMS \nThe world of the Forgotten Realms provides an \nextensive example of currencies. Although barter, \nblood notes, and similar letters of trade are common \nenough in Faerfin, metal coins and trade bars are the \neveryday currency. \nCommon Coinage. Coins appear in a bewildering \nvariety of shapes, sizes, names, and materials. Thanks \nto the ambitious traders of Sembia, that nation\'s oddly \nshaped coins can be found throughout Faerfin. In \nS embia, square iron steelpence replace copper coins. \nTriangular silver pieces are ravens, diamond-shaped \nelectrum pieces are harmarks (commonly called "blue \neyes"), and five-sided gold pieces are nobles. Sembia \ndoesn\'t mint platinum coins. All coinage is accepted \nin Sembia, including copper and platinum pieces \nfrom abroad. \nIn Waterdeep, the bustling cosmopolitan center \nof trade, coppers are called nibs, silvers are shards, \nCHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \n19 \n'},

  'text': "20 \nelectrum pieces are moons, gold pieces are dragons, \nand platinum coins are suns. The city's two local coins \nare the toal and the harbor moon. The toal is a square \nbrass trading-coin pierced with a central hole to permit \nit to be easily strung on a ring or string, worth 2 gp in \nthe city and nothing outside Waterdeep. The harbor \nmoon is a flat crescent of platinum with a central \nhole and an electrum inlay, named for its traditional \nuse in the docks for buying large amounts of cargo at \nonce. The coin is worth 50 gp in Waterdeep and 30 gp \nelsewhere. \nThe northern city of Silverymoon mints a crescent-\nshaped, shining blue coin called an electrum moon, \nworth 1 gp in that city and 1 ep elsewhere. The city also \nissues a larger coin called an eclipsed moon, which \nlooks like an electrum moon combined a darker silver \nwedge to form a round coin worth 5 ep within the city \nand 2 ep outside it. \nThe favored form of currency in the kingdom of \nCormyr is the royal coinage of the court, stamped with \na dragon on one side and a treasury date mark on the \nother. There, coppers are called thumbs, silvers are \nsilver falcons, electrum pieces are blue eyes, gold pieces \nare golden lions, and platinum coins are tricrowns. \nEven city-states mint their own copper, silver, and gold \npieces. Electrum and platinum pieces are rarer in these \nlands. Smaller states use coinage borrowed from other \nnations and looted from ancient sources. Travelers from \ncertain lands (notably the wizard-dominated realms of \nThay and Halruaa) use the currencies of other realms \nwhen trading abroad because their own coins and \ntokens are feared to be magically cursed, and so are \nshunned by others. \nConversely, the coins of long-lost, legendary lands \nand centers of great magic are honored, though those \nwho find them are wise to sell them to collectors rather \nthan merely spending them in markets. The coins of the \nold elven court of Cormanthyr are particularly famous: \nthalvers (coppers), bedoars (silvers), thammarchs \n(electrum), shilmaers (golds), and ruendils (platinum). \nThese coins are fine, numerous, and sometimes still \nused in trade among elves. \nGoLD CoiN \nELECTRUM COIN \nSILVER COIN \nPLATINUM Co1N \nCHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \nTrade Bars. Large numbers of coins can be difficult \nto transport and account for. Many merchants prefer \nto use trade bars-ingots of precious metals and alloys \n(usually silver) likely to be accepted by virtually anyone. \nTrade bars are stamped or graven with the symbol of the \ntrading company or government that originally crafted \nthem. These bars are valued by weight, as follows: \n• A 2-pound silver bar is worth 10 gp and is about 5 \ninches long, 2 inches wide, and 1/2 inch thick. \nA 5-pound silver bar is worth 25 gp and is about 6 \ninches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. \nA 5-pound gold bar is worth 250 gp and is about the \nsize of a 2-pound silver bar. \nThe city of Baldur's Gate mints large numbers of \nsilver trade bars and sets the standard for this form of \ncurrency. The city of Mirabar issues black iron spindle-\nshaped trade bars with squared ends weighing about \n2 pounds each, worth 10 gp in that city, markedly less \nin nearby trade centers, and as iron is normally valued \nelsewhere (1 sp per pound). \nOdd Currency. Coins and bars aren't the only forms \nof hard currency. Gond bells are small brass bells worth \n10 gp in trade, or 20 gp to a temple of Gond. Shaar \nrings, pierced and polished slices of ivory threaded \nonto strings by the nomads of the Shaar, are worth 3 gp \nper slice. \nCREATING YouR OwN \nAs shown in the previous examples, currency doesn't \nneed to obey a universal standard in your world. Each \ncountry and era can have its own coins with its own \nvalues. Your adventurers might travel through many \ndifferent lands and find long-lost treasures. Finding \n· six hundred ancient bed oars from the rule of Coronal \nEltargrim twelve centuries before offers a deeper sense \nof immersion in your world than finding 60 sp. \nVarying names and descriptions of coins for the \nmajor contemporary and historical realms of your world \nadds an additional layer of texture. The golden lions of \nCormyr convey the noble nature of that kingdom. If a \nnation mints gold coins stamped with leering demonic \nfaces and called torments, that currency expresses a \ndistinct flavor. \nCreating new coins connected to specific locations, \nlike the toals ofWaterdeep or the eclipsed moons of \nSilverymoon, provides another level of detail. As long as \nyou keep the value of these new coins simple (in other \nwords, don't invent a coin worth 1.62 gp), you add local \nflavor to key locations in your world without adding \nundue complexity. \nLANGUAGES AND DIALECTS \nWhen fleshing out your world, you can create new \nlanguages and dialects to reflect its unique geography \nand history. You can replace the default languages \npresented in the Player's Handbook with new ones, or \nsplit languages up into several different dialects. \nIn some worlds, regional differences might be much \nmore important than racial ones. Perhaps all the \ndwarves, elves, and humans who live in one kingdom \nspeak a common language, which is completely different \n"},

This \nmight make communication (and diplomacy) between \nrwo kingdoms significantly more difficult. \nWidely used languages might have ancient versions, \nor there might be completely different ancient tongues \nthat adventurers find written in tombs and ruins. Such \nlanguages can add an element of mystery to inscriptions \nand tomes that characters encounter. \nYou might invent additional secret languages, besides \nDruidic and thieves\' cant, that allow members of certain \norganizations or political affiliations to communicate. \nYou could even decide that each alignment has its \nown language, which might be more of an argot used \nprimarily to discuss philosophical concepts. \nIn a region where one race has subjugated another, \nthe language of the conquerors can become a mark of \nocial status. Similarly, reading and writing might be \nrestricted by law to the upper classes of a society. \nFACTIONS AND \nORGANIZATIONS \nTemples, guilds, orders, secret societies, and \ncolleges are important for.ces in the social order of \nany civilization. Their influence might stretch across \nmultiple towns and cities, with or without a similarly \nwide-ranging political authority. Organizations can \nplay an important part in the Jives of player characters, \nbecoming their patrons, allies, or enemies just like \nindividual non player characters. When characters join \nthese organizations, they become part of something \nlarger than themselves, which can give their adventures \na context in the wider world. \nADVENTURERS AND ORGANIZATIONS \nAt the start of a campaign, backgrounds are a great \nway to connect adventurers to your world. As the game \nprogresses, though, background ties often become less \nimportant. \nFactions and organizations aimed at player characters \nare a way to keep higher-level adventurers connected \nm your world, providing ties to key NPCs and a clear \nagenda beyond individual gain. In the same way, \nYillainous organizations create an ongoing sense of \nmenace above and beyond the threat of solitary foes. \nHaving different characters tied to different factions \ncan create interesting situations at the gaming table, as \nlong as those factions have similar goals and don\'t work \nin opposition to one another all the time. Adventurers \nrepresenting different factions might have competing \ninterests or priorities while they pursue the same goals. \nAdventurer organizations are also a great source of \nspecial rewards beyond experience points and treasure. \nIncreased standing in an organization has value in and \nof itself, and might also come with concrete benefits \nsuch as access to an organization\'s information, \nequipment, magic, and other resources. \nCREATING FACTIONS \nFactions and organizations that you create for your \ncampaign should grow out of the stories that are \nimportant to the world. Create organizations that your \nplayers will want to interact with, whether as allies, \nmembers, or enemies. \nAs a starting point, decide what role you want an \norganization to play in the world. What is it all about? \nWhat are its goals? Who founded it and why? What do \nits members do? Answering these questions should \nSAMPLE FACTION: THE HARPERS \nThe Harpers is a scattered network of spellcasters and spies \nwho advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of \npower, magical or otherwise. \nThe organization has risen, been shattered, and risen \nagain several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely \ndue to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the \nautonomy of its various members. The Harpers have small \ncells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms, \nalthough they interact and share information with one \nanother from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers\' \nideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their \ningenuity and incorruptibility. Harpers don\'t seek power or \nglory, only fair and equal treatment for all . \nMotto. "Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all." \nBeliefs. The Harpers\' beliefs can be summarized as follows: \nOne can never have too much information or arcane \nknowledge. \n• Too much power leads to corruption, and the abuse of \nmagic in particular must be closely monitored. \nNo one should be powerless. \nGoals. Gather information throughout FaerCln, discern \nthe political dynamics within each region, and promote \nfairness and equality by covert means. Act openly as a last \nresort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group \nthat grows too powerful. Aid the weak, the poor, and the \noppressed . \nTypical Quests.

  'text': 'give you a good sense of the organization\'s personality. \nFrom there, think about typical members. How might \npeople describe them? What are the typical members\' \nclasses and alignments? What personality traits do they \ntend to share? \nChoosing a symbol and a motto for the organization \nis a way of summing up the work you\'ve done so far. \nA faction that uses a stag as a symbol probably has a \nvery different personality from one that uses a winged \nviper. For a motto, choose not just a message but also \na tone and style of speech that fits the organization as \nyou\'ve defined it. Consider the motto of the Harpers: \n"Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all." The \nHarpers have a straightforward message of freedom \nand prosperity. Contrast that with the motto of a \ngroup of politically allied cities in the North calling \nthemselves the Lords\' Alliance: "Threats to home must \nbe terminated without prejudice. Superiority is our \nsecurity." These are sophisticated people involved in \na delicate political alliance, with more emphasis on \nstability than on fairness and equality. \nFinally, think about the ways that player characters \nmight come into contact with the organization. Who \nare the important members-not just the leaders, \nbut the agents in the field that the adventurers might \nencounter? Where are they active, and where do they \nhave headquarters or strongholds? If adventurers do \njoin, what kind of missions might they be sent on? What \nrewards can they gain? \nRENOWN \nRenown is an optional rule you can use to track an \nadventurer\'s standing within a particular faction or \norganization. Renown is a numerical value that starts \nat 0, then increases as a character earns favor and \nreputation within a particular organization. You can tie \nbenefits to a character\'s renown, including ranks and \ntitles within the organization and access to resources. \nA player tracks renown separately for each \norganization his or her character is a member of. For \nexample, an adventurer might have 5 renown within \none faction and 20 renown within another, based on the \ncharacter\'s interaction with each organization over the \ncourse of the campaign. \nGAINING RENOWN \nA character earns renown by completing missions or \nquests that serve an organization\'s interests or involve \nthe organization directly. You award renown at your \ndiscretion as characters complete these missions \nor quests, typically at the same time you award \nexperience points. \nEXAMPLES OF FACTION RANKS \nRenown \nHarpers \nOrder ofthe Gauntlet \nWatcher \nCheval I \n3 \nHarpshadow \nMarcheon \n10 \nBrightcandle \nWhitehawk \n25 \nWise Owl \nVindicator \n50 \nHigh Harper \nRighteous Hand \nCHAPTER l I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \nAdvancing an organization\'s interests increases \na character\'s renown within that organization by 1. \nCompleting a mission specifically assigned by that \norganization, or which directly benefits the organization, \nincreases the character\'s renown by 2 instead. \nFor example, characters with connections to the noble \nOrder of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which \nthey free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. \nBecause the order likes to punish evildoers, you might \nincrease each character\'s renown within the order \nby 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission \ngiven to the adventurers by a senior member of the \norder, completing the task might instead increase each \ncharacter\'s renown by 2, showing the adventurers as \neffective allies. \nMeanwhile, the party\'s rogue might have looted a box \nof rare poisons from the dragon\'s hoard and sold it to \na fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might \nincrease the rogue\'s renown within the Zhentarim by 2 \nsince this action directly increased that group\'s power \nand wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an \nagent of the Zhentarim. \nBENEFITS OF RENOWN \nThe benefits of increasing renown within an \norganization can include rank and authority, friendly \nattitudes from members of the organization, and \nother perks. \nRank. Characters can earn promotions as their \nrenown increases. You can establish certain thresholds \nof renown that serve as prerequisites (though not \nnecessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in \nrank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table. \nFor example, a character might join the Lords\' Alliance \nafter earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining \nthe title of cloak. As the character\'s renown within the \norganization increases, he or she might be eligible for \nfurther increases in rank. \nYou can add rank prerequisites. For example, a \ncharacter affiliated with the Lords\' Alliance might have \nto be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at \nleast lOth level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level \nto be a lioncrown. \nYou can set these thresholds of renown to any \nnumbers that work for your game, creating appropriate \nranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign. \nAttitudes of Organization Members. As a character\'s \nrenown within an organization grows, members of \nthat organization are increasingly likely to have heard \nof the character. You can set thresholds at which the \ndefault attitude of an organization\'s members toward \nthe character becomes indifferent or friendly.

NPC \nfaction members might dislike an adventurer despite \nthat character\'s renown-or perhaps because of it. \nPerks. Earning a rank within an organization comes \nwith certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of \nlow rank might gain access to a reliable contact and \nadventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to \noffer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked \ncharacter might gain a follower (see chapter 4, "Creating \n_ -onplayer Characters"), access to potions and scrolls, \nthe ability to call in a favor, or backup on dangerous \nmissions. A high-ranking character might be able to \ncall on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, \ngain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special \nmissions to members of lower rank. \nDowntime Activities. You might allow characters \nto spend downtime between adventures building \n;elationships and gaining renown within an \norganization. For more information on downtime \nactivities, see chapter 6, "Between Adventures." \nL OSING RENOWN \nDisagreements with members of an organization \naren\'t enough to cause a loss of renown within that \norganization. However, serious offenses committed \nagainst the organization or its members can result \nin a loss of renown and rank within the organization. \nThe extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is \nleft to your discretion. A character\'s renown within an \norganization can never drop below 0. \nPIETY \n\\Vith a few alterations, the renown system can also \nerve as a measure of a character\'s link to the gods. It\'s \na great option for campaigns where the gods take active \nroles in the world. \nUsing this approach, you track renown based on \npecific divine figures in your campaign. Each character \nbas the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with \ngoals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any \nrenown he or she earns is called piety. A character \ngains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their \ncommands,. and respecting their taboos. A character \nloses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring \nthem, defiling their temples, and foiling their aims. \nThe gods bestow favors on those who prove their \ndevotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character \ncan pray for divine favor once per day. This favor usually \ncomes in the form of a cleric spell like bless. The favor \noften comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for \nexample, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a \npel! accompanied by the boom of thunder. \nA high level of piety can also lead to a character \ngaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a \nblessing or charm (see chapter 7, "Treasure," for such \nupernatural gifts). \nMAGIC IN YouR WoRLD \nIn most D&amp;D worlds, magic is natural but still wondrous \nand sometimes frightening. People everywhere know \nabout magic, and most people see evidence of it at some \npoint in their lives. It permeates the cosmos and moves \nthrough the ancient possessions of legendary heroes, \nthe mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched \nby the gods, creatures born with supernatural power, \nand individuals who study the secrets of the multiverse. \nHistories and fireside tales are filled with the exploits of \nthose who wield it. \nWhat normal folk know of magic depends on where \nth.ey live and whether they know characters who \npractice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not \nhave seen true magic used for generations and speak \nin whispers of the strange powers of the old hermit \nliving in the nearby woods. In the city of Waterdeep \nin the Forgotten Realms setting, the Watchful Order \nof Magists and Protectors is a guild of wizards. These \narcanists wish to make wizardry more accessible so the \norder\'s members can profit from selling their services. \nSome D&amp;D settings have more magic in them than \nothers. On Athas, the harsh world of the Dark Sun \nsetting, arcane magic is a hated practice that can drain \nlife from the world. Much of Athas\'s magic lies in the \nhands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of Eberron, \nmagic is as commonplace as any other commodity. \nMercantile houses sell magic items and services to \nSAMPLE FACTION: THE ZHENTARIM \nThe Zhentarim (also known as the Black Network) is an \nunscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its \ninfluence and power throughout the Forgotten Realms. \nThe public face of the Black Network appears relatively \nbenign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, \nboth legal and illicit, thus destroying its competitors and \nmaking everyone dependent on it. \nA member of the Zhentarim thinks of himself or herself \nas a member of a very large family and relies on the Black \nNetwork for resources and security. However, members are \ngranted the autonomy to pursue their own interests and gain \nsome measure of personal wealth and influence. As a whole, \nthe Zhentarim promises "the best of the best," although \nin truth the organization is more interested in spreading \nits own propaganda and influence than investing in the \nimprovement of its individual members. \nMotto. "join us and prosper. Oppose us and suffer." \nBeliefs. The Zhentarim\'s beliefs can be summarized \nas follows: \n• The Zhentarim is your family. You watch out for it, and it \nwatches out for you. \n• You are the master of your own destiny. Never be less than \nwhat you deserve to be. \nEverything and everyone has a price. \nGoals. Amass wealth, power, and influence, and thereby \ndominate Faerun. \nTypical Quests. Typical Zhentarim quests include \nplundering or stealing a treasure hoard, powerful magic item, \nor artifact; securing a lucrative business contract or enforcing \na preexisting one; and establishing a foothold in a place \nwhere the Zhentarim holds little sway. \nCH APTER I I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \n23 \n'},

  'text': "anyone who can afford them. People purchase tickets to \nride airships and trains propelled by elemental magic. \nConsider these questions -when fitting magic into \nyour world: \nIs some magic common? Is some socially \nunacceptable? Which magic is rare? \nHow unusual are members of each spellcasting \nclass? How common are those who can cast high-\nlevel spells? \nHow rare are magic items, magical locations, \nand creatures that have supernatural powers? At \nwhat power level do these things go from everyday \nto exotic? \nHow do authorities regulate and use magic? How \ndo normal folks use magic and protect them-\nselves from it? \nThe answers to some questions suggest the answers \nto others. For example, if spell casters of low-level \nspells are common, as in Eberron, then authorities and \ncommon folk are more likely to have access to and use \nthe results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic \nisn't only possible, but also less expensive. People are \nmore likely to keep well-known magic in mind, and to \nprotect against it, especially in risky situations. \nRESTRICTIONS ON MAGIC \nSome civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use \nof magic. Spellcasting might be forbidden without a \nlicense or official permission. In such a place, magic \nitems and continual magical effects are rare, with \nprotections against magic being the exception. \nSome localities might prohibit specific spells. It could \nbe a crime to cast any spells used to steal or swindle, \nsuch as those that bestow invisibility or produce \nillusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate others \nare readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of \nfree will. Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for \nobvious reasons. A local ruler could have a phobia about \na specific effect or spell (such as shapeshifting effects if \nhe or she were afraid of being impersonated) and enact \na law restricting that type of magic. \nSCHOOLS OF MAGIC \nThe rules of the game refer to the schools of magic \n(abjuration, illusion, necromancy, and so on), but it's \nup to you to determine what those schools signify in \nyour world. Similarly, a few class options suggest the \nexistence of magic-using organizations in the world-\nbardic colleges and druid circles- which are up to you to \nflesh out. \n· \nYou could decide that no formal structures like these \nexist in your world. Wizards (and bards and druids) \nmight be so rare that a player character learns from a \nsingle mentor and never meets another character of the \nsame class, in which case wizards would learn their \nschool specialization without any formal training. \nHowever, if magic is more common, academies can \nbe the embodiments of the schools of magic. These \ninstitutions have their own hierarchies, traditions, \nregulations, and procedures. For example, Materros \nthe necromancer could be a brother of the necromantic \nCHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \nCabal of Thar-Zad. As a sign of his high standing within \nits hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green \nrobes of a master. Of course, when he wears these \nrobes, his occupation is easily identified by those who \nknow of the cabal. This recognition could be a boon or \na nuisance, since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a fearsome \nreputation. \nIf you go this route, you can treat schools of magic, \nbardic colleges, and druid circles as organizations, \nusing the guidelines for organizations presented earlier \nin this chapter. A player character necromancer might \ncultivate renown within the Cabal of Thar-Zad, while \na bard seeks increasing renown within the College of \nMac-Fuirmidh. \nTELEPORTATION CIRCLES \nThe presence of permanent teleportation circles in \nmajor cities helps cement their important place in the \neconomy of a fantasy world. Spells such as plane shift, \nteleport, and teleportation circle connect with these \ncircles, which are found in temples, academies, the \nheadquarters of arcane organizations, and prominent \ncivic locations. However, since every teleportation circle \nis a possible means of entry into a city, they're guarded \nby military and magical protection. \nAs you design a fantasy city, think about the \nteleportation circles it might contain and which ones \nadventurers are likely to know about. If the adventurers \ncommonly return to their home base by means of \na teleportation circle, use that circle as a hook for \nplot developments in your campaign. What do the \nadventurers do if they arrive in a teleportation circle and \nfind all the familiar wards disabled and guards lying \nin pools of blood? What if their arrival interrupts an \n.argument between two feuding priests at the temple? \nAdventure ensues! \nBRINGING BACK THE DEAD \nWhen a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves \nthe Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, \nand goes to abide on the plane where the creature's \ndeity resides. If the creature didn't worship a deity, its \nsoul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. \nBringing someone back from the dead means retrieving \nthe soul from that plane and returning it to its body. \nEnemies can take steps to make it more difficult for \na character to be returned from the dead. Keeping \nthe body prevents others from using raise dead or \nresurrection to restore the slain character to life. \nA soul can't be returned to life if it doesn't wish to \nbe. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron \ndeity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and \nmight refuse to return on that basis. For example, if \nthe honorable knight Sturm Brightblade is slain and a \nhigh priestess of Takhisis (god of evil dragons) grabs \nhis body, Sturm might not wish to be raised from the \ndead by her. Any attempts she makes to revive him \nautomatically fail. If the evil cleric wants to revive Sturm \nto interrogate him, she needs to find some way to trick \nhis soul, such as duping a good cleric into raising him \nand then capturing him once he is alive again. \n"},

  'text': 'CREATING A CAMPAIGN \nThe world you create is the stage for the \nadventures you set in it. You don\'t have to give more \nthought to it than that. You can run adventures in \nan episodic format, with the characters as the only \ncommon element, and also weave themes throughout \nthose adventures to build a greater saga of the \ncharacters\' achievements in the world. \nP lanning an entire campaign might seem like a \ndaunting task, but you don\'t have to plot out every \ndetail right from the start. You can start with the \nbasics, running a few adventures, and think about \nlarger plotlines you want to explore as the campaign \nprogresses. You\'re free to add as much or as little detail \na you wish. \nThe start of a campaign resembles the start of an \nadventure. You want to jump quickly into the action, \nhow the players that adventure awaits, and grab \ntheir attention right away. Give the players enough \ninformation to make them want to come back week after \n·eek to see how the story plays out. \nSTART SMALL \n\\"hen you first start building your campaign, start \n-mall. The characters need to know only about the \ncity, town, or village where they start the game, and \nperhaps the nearby dungeon. You might decide that \nthe barony is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a \ndistant forest is crawling with ettercaps and giant \npiders, and you should note these things. But at \nthe start of the game, the local area is enough to get \nthe campaign off the ground. Follow these steps to \ncreate that local area: \n1. CREATE A HOME BASE \nee the "Settlements" section earlier in this chapter \n;"or guidance on building this settlement. A small \n·own or village at the edge of the wilderness serves \na fine home base in most D&amp;D campaigns. Use \na larger town or city if you want a campaign with \nrban adventuring. \n2. CREATE A LOCAL REGION \n- ee "Mapping the Campaign" earlier in this chapter \n:or guidance. Draw a map at province scale (1 hex= \nl mile) with the home base near the center. Fill \nn the area within a day\'s travel-about 25 to 30 \n:niles-of the home base. Pepper it with two to \n:our dungeons or similar adventure locales . \n. -ill area that size is likely to have one to three \nadditional settlements as well as the home base, \nso give thought to them as well. \n3. CRAFT A STARTING ADVENTURE \ningle dungeon makes a good first adventure \n\'or most campaigns. See chapter 3, "Creating \n_ dventures," for guidance. \nA home base provides a common starting \n.ocation for the characters. This starting point \nmight be the village where they grew up or a \nci _- that attracted them from points beyond. \n'},

  'text': 'Or perhaps they begin the campaign in the dungeons \nof an evil baron\'s castle where they\'ve been locked up \nfor various reasons (legitimate or otherwise), throwing \nthem into the midst of the adventure. \nFor each of these steps, give the locations only as \nmuch detail as they need. You don\'t need to identify \nevery building in a village or label every street in a large \ncity. If the characters start in the baron\'s dungeon, you\'ll \nneed the details of this first adventure site, but you \ndon\'t have to name all the baron\'s knights. Sketch out \na simple map, think about the surrounding area, and \nconsider whom the characters are most likely to interact \nwith early in the campaign. Most important, visualize \nhow this area fits into the theme and story you have in \nmind for your campaign. Then start working on your \nfirst adventure! \nSET THE STAGE \nAs you start to develop your campaign, you\'ll need to \nfill in the players on the basics. For easy distribution, \ncompile essential information into a campaign \nhandout. Such a handout typically includes the \nfollowing material: \nAny restrictions or new options for character creation, \nsuch as new or prohibited races. \nAny information in the backs tory of your campaign \nthat the characters would know about. If you have \na theme or direction in mind for the campaign, this \ninformation could include seeds hinting at that focus. \n• Basic information about the area where the characters \nare starting, such as the name of the town, important \nlocations in and around it, prominent NPCs they\'d \nknow about, and perhaps rumors that point to trouble \nthat\'s brewing. \nKeep this handout short and to the point. Two pages \nis a reasonable maximum. Even if you have a burst of \ncreative energy that produces twenty pages of great \nbackground material, save it for your adventures. Let \nthe players uncover the details gradually in play. \nINVOLVING THE CHARACTERS \nOnce you\'ve identified what your campaign is about, \nlet the players help tell the story by deciding how their \ncharacters are involved. This is their opportunity to \ntie their characters\' history and background to the \ncampaign, and a chance for you to determine how the \nvarious elements of each character\'s background tie \ninto the campaign\'s story. For example, what secret has \nthe hermit character learned? What is the status of the \nnoble character\'s family? What is the folk hero\'s destiny? \nSome players might have trouble coming up with \nideas-not everyone is equally inventive. You can help \nspur their creativity with a few questions about their \ncharacters: \nAre you a native, born and raised in the area? If so, \nwho\'s your family? What\'s your current occupation? \n• Are you a recent arrival? Where did you come from? \nWhy did you come to this area? \nCHAPTER I I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \nAre you tied to any of the organizations or people \ninvolved in the events that kick off the campaign? Are \nthey friends or enemies? \nListen to the players\' ideas, and say yes if you can. \nEven if you want all the characters to have grown up in \nthe starting town, consider allowing a recent arrival or \na transplant if the player\'s story is convincing enough. \nSuggest alterations to a character\'s story so it better fits \nyour world, or weave the first threads of your campaign \ninto that story. \nCREATING A BACKGROUND \nBackgrounds are designed to root player characters \nin the world, and creating new backgrounds is a great \nway to introduce players to the special features of your \nworld. Backgrounds that have ties to particular cultures, \norganizations, and historical events from your campaign \nare particularly strong. Perhaps the priests of a certain \nreligion live as beggars supported by a pious populace, \nsinging the tales of their deity\'s exploits to entertain \nand enlighten the faithful. You could create a mendicant \npriest background (or modify the acolyte background) \nto reflect these qualities. It could include musical \ninstrument proficiency, and its feature probably involves \nreceiving hospitality from the faithful. \nGuidelines for creating a new background are \nprovided in chapter 9, "Dungeon Master\'s Workshop." \nCAMPAIGN EVENTS \nSignificant events in the history of a fantasy world tend \ntoward immense upheavals: wars that pit the forces \nof good against evil in an epic confrontation, natural \ndisasters that lay waste to entire civilizations, invasions \nof vast armies or extra planar hordes, assassinations \nof world leaders. These world-shaking events title the \nchapters of history. \nIn a D&amp;D game, such events provide the sparks that \ncan ignite and sustain a campaign. The most common \npitfall of serial stories without a set beginning, mfddle, \nand end is inertia. Like many television shows and \ncomic-book series, a D&amp;D campaign runs the risk of \nretreading the same ground long after the enjoyment\'s \ngone. Just as actors or writers drift away from those \nother mediums, so can players- the actors and writers \nof a D&amp;D game. Games stagnate when the story \nmeanders too long without a change in tone, when the \nsame villains and similar adventures grow tiresome and \npredictable, and when the world doesn\'t change around \nthe characters and in response to their actions. \nWorld-shaking events force conflict. They set new \nevents and power groups in motion. Their outcomes \nchange the world by altering the tone of the setting \nin a meaningful way. They chronicle the story of your \nworld in big, bold print. Change- especially change that \noccurs as a result of the characters\' actions-keeps the \nstory moving. If change is imperceptible, the actions \nof the characters lack significance. When the world \nbecomes reliable, it\'s time to shake things up. \n'},

  'text': 'PuTTING EvENTS IN MoTION \n--------\nWorld-shaking events can happen at any time in \na campaign or story arc, but the biggest incidents \nnaturally fall at the beginning, middle, and end \nof a story. \nThat placement reflects the structure of dramatic \nstories. At the beginning of a story, something happens \nto shake the protagonists\' world and spur them into \naction. The characters take action to resolve their \nproblems, but other forces oppose them. As they reach a \nsignificant milestone toward their goal, a major conflict \ndisrupts the characters\' plans, shaking their world \nagain; failure seems imminent. At the end of the story, \nthey succeed or fail, and the world is shaken again by \nthe way the characters changed it for good or ill. \nAt the beginning of a D&amp;D campaign, world-shaking \nevents create instant adventure hooks and affect the \ncharacters\' lives directly. In the middle, they make great \nturning points as the characters\' fortunes reverse-\nrising after a defeat or falling after a victory. Near \nthe end of a campaign, such events serve as excellent \nclimactic episodes with far-reaching effects. They might \neven occur after the story has ended, as a result of the \ncharacters\' actions. \nWHEN NoT To SHAKE IT UP -----\nIn constructing a narrative, beware of "false action," \nor action for its own sake. False action doesn\'t move \na story forward, engage characters, or cause them to \nchange. Many action movies suffer from false action, in \nwhich car chases, gunfights, and explosions abound but \ndo little more than inconvenience the characters and \neventually bore the audience with their repetition and \ndearth of meaningful stakes. Some D&amp;D campaigns fall \ninto the same trap, stringing world-spanning disasters \ntogether one after another with little impact on the \ncharacters or the world. Thus, it\'s probably not in the \nDM\'s best interest to reorder the world every single time \nthere\'s a lull in the action, lest world-shaking events \nbecome ordinary. \nAs a general rule, a campaign can sustain up to \nthree large-scale, world-shaking events: one near the \nbeginning, one near the middle, and one near the \nend. Use as many small-scale events that disturb the \nbounded microcosms of towns, villages, tribes, fiefs, \nduchies, provinces, and so forth as you like. Every \nsignificant event shakes someone\'s ·world, after all, no \nmatter how small that world might be. Let unexpected \nand terrible events regularly afflict the world\'s smaller \nterritories, but unless your story demands it, save the \nlarge-scale map-spanning events for the biggest, most \nimportant moments of your campaign. \nWORLD-SHAKING EVENTS -------\nYou can use this section for ideas and inspiration to \nexpand on world-shaking events already occurring (or \noon to occur) within your world. Alternatively, you can \nroll on the tables below to randomly generate an event \nto inspire your imagination. The attempt to justify a \nrandom result can reveal unforeseen possibilities. \nTo get started, select a world-shaking event category \nor roll on the World-Shaking Events table. \nWORLD-SHAKING EVENTS \ndlO \nEvent \nRise of a leader or an era \n2 \nFall of a leader or an era \n3 \nCataclysmic disaster \n4 \nAssault or invasion \n5 \nRebellion, revolution , overthrow \n6 \nExtinction or depletion \n7 \nNew organization \n8 \nDiscovery, expansion, invention \n9 \nPrediction, omen, prophecy \n10 \nMyth and legend \n1-2. RISE OR FALL OF A LEADER OR AN ERA \nEras are often defined by the prominent leaders, \ninnovators, and tyrants of the day. These people change \nthe world and etch their signatures indelibly on the \npages of history. When they rise to power, they shape \nthe time and place where they live in monumental ways. \nWhen they fall from power or pass away, the ghost of \ntheir presence lingers. \nDetermine the kind of leader that influences the new \nor passing era.

Major military \nleaders control the armed forces of countries. They \ninclude military dictators, warlords, and the heads of \na ruler\'s war council. Minor military leaders include \nthe heads of local militias, gangs, and other martial \norganizations. At the broadest scale, a criminal or \nunderworld leader wields power through a network of \nspies, bribes, and black-market trade. On the smallest \nscale, these are local gang bosses, pirate captains, and \nbrigands. A leader in art or culture is a virtuoso whose \nwork reflects the spirit of the age and changes the way \npeople think: a prominent playwright, bard, or court fool \nin whose words, art, or performance the people perceive \nuniversal truth. On a smaller scale, this might be an \ninfluential local poet, minstrel, satirist, or sculptor. \nA major leader in philosophy, learning, or magic is \na genius philosopher, a counselor to emperors, an \nenlightened thinker, the head of the highest institution \nof learning in the world, or an archmage.

  'text': "might be a local sage, seer, hedge wizard, wise elder, \nor teacher. \nRise of a Leader, Beginning of an Era. In dramatic \nstories, a new leader's rise often comes at the end of \na period of struggle or turmoil. Sometimes it's a war \nor uprising; other times it's an election, the death of a \ntyrant, a prophecy fulfilled, or the appointment of a hero. \nConversely, the new leader might be a tyrant, a fiend, or \nblack-hearted villain, and the era that just ended could \nhave been one of peace, tranquility, and justice. \nA new leader shakes the foundations of your campaign \nworld and begins a new era in the selected region. How \ndoes this person or this era begin to affect the world? \nHere are several things to consider when determining \nthe leader's impact on the world: \n• Name one thing that has been consistently true about \nthe world, which is now no longer true due to this \nleader's rise or influence. This is the biggest change \nthat occurs when the new leader takes power and \nbecomes the prevailing trait that defines the era, the \ncharacteristic for which it is remembered. \n• Name the person (or people) whose death, defeat, or \nloss opened the door for this leader to take power. \nThis might be a military defeat, the overthrow of \nold ideas, a cultural rebirth, or something else. Who \ndied, lost, or was defeated? What weren't they willing \nto compromise? Was the new leader complicit in \nthe death, defeat, or loss, or was the opportunity \nserendipitous? \n• Despite the leader's virtues, one flaw in particular \noutrages a certain segment of the populace. What \nis that flaw? What person or group of persons will \ndo their utmost to foil this leader because of it? \nConversely, what is this leader's greatest virtue, and \nwho rises to the leader's defense because of it? \n• Who believes in this leader now, but still retains \ndoubts? This is someone close to the leader, who has \nthe leader's trust and knows his or her secret fears, \ndoubts, or vices. \nFaJJ of a Leader, End of an Era. All that begins must \nend. With the fall of kings and queens, the maps of the \nworld are redrawn. Laws change, new customs become \nall the rage, and old ones fall out of favor. The attitude \nof the citizens toward their fallen leader shifts subtly at \nfirst and then changes dramatically as they look back or \nreminisce about the time before. \nThe fallen leader might have been a benevolent \nruler, an influential citizen, or even an adversary to the \ncharacters. How does the death of this person affect \nthose formerly under his or her influence? ijere are \nseveral things to consider when determining the effects \nof a leader's passing: \n• Name one positive change that the leader brought to \nhis or her domain or sphere of influence. Does that \nchange persist after the leader's death? \nState the general mood or attitude of the people under \nthis person's power. What important fact didn't they \nrealize about this person or his or her reign, which \nwill later come to light? \nName one person or group that tries to fill the leader's \nshoes in the resulting power vacuum. \nCHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \nName one person or group that plotted against \nthis leader. \nName three things for which this leader will be \nremembered. \n3. CATACLYSMIC DISASTER \nEarthquake, famine, fire, plague, flood- disasters on a \ngrand scale can eradicate whole civilizations without \nwarning. Natural (or magical) catastrophes redraw \nmaps, destroy economies, and alter worlds. Sometimes \nthe survivors rebuild from the ruins. The Great Chicago \nFire, for instance, provided an opportunity to rebuild \nthe city according to a modern plan. Most of the time \nthe disaster leaves only ruins- buried under ash like \nPompeii, or sunk beneath the waves like Atlantis. \nYou can choose the cataclysm or determine one \nrandomly using the Cataclysmic Disasters table. \nCATACLYSMIC DISASTERS \ndlO \nCataclysmic Disaster \nEarthquake \n2 \nFaminefdrought \n3 \nFire \n4 \nFlood \n5 \nPlaguefd isease \n6 \nRain of fire (meteoric impact) \n7 \nStorm (hurricane, tornado, tsunami) \n8 \nVolcanic eruption \n9 \nMagic gone awry or a planar warp \n10 \nDivine judgment \nSome of the disasters on the table might not make \nimmediate sense in the context of your campaign \nworld. A flood in the desert? A volcanic eruption on \ngrassy plains? If you randomly determine a disaster \nthat conflicts with your setting, you can reroll, but the \nchallenge of justifying the catastrophe can produce \ninteresting results. \nWith two exceptions, the disasters on the table \nresemble those that affect our own world. Think \nof planar warps and magic gone awry like nuclear \nincidents; they're big events that unnaturally alter \nthe land and its people. For example, in the Eberron \ncampaign setting, a magical catastrophe lays waste \nto an entire country, transforming it into a hostile \nwasteland and ending the Last War. \nDivine judgment is something else entirely. This \ndisaster takes whatever form you want, but it's always a \nbig, bold, unsubtle sign of a deity's displeasure. \nYou might decide to wipe a town, region, or nation off \nthe map of your world. A disaster ravages the land and \neffectively eliminates a place the characters once knew. \nLeave one or two survivors to tell the characters what \nhappened, and ensure that the characters feel the depth \nof the catastrophe. What are the ongoing effects of this \ncataclysm? The following points can help you define the \nnature and consequences of the disaster: \n• Decide what caused this cataclysm and where it \noriginated. \n• An omen presaged this event, or a series of signs and \nomens.

REBELLION, REVOLUTION, OVERTHROW \nDissatisfied with the current order, a person or group \nof people overturns the dominant regime and takes \nover-or fails to take over. Regardless of the result, a \nrevolution (even an attempted one) can shape the destiny \nof nations. \nThe scale of a revolution need not involve the common \nmasses against the nobility. A revolution can be as small \nas a merchants' guild revolting against its leadership \nor a temple overthrowing its priesthood in favor of a \nnew creed.

New resources or archaeological finds \ncreate opportunity and wealth and set prospectors and \npower groups in motion to vie for their control. \nA new discovery-or rediscovery-can impact your \ncampaign world in a meaningful way, shaping the \ncourse of history and the events of the age. Think of this \ndiscovery as a big adventure hook or series of hooks. \nThis is also an opportunity to create a unique monster, \nitem, god, plane, or race for your world. As long as the \ndiscovery matters, it doesn't have to be wholly original, \njust flavored for your campaign. \nA discovery is particularly impressive when the \nadventurers in your campaign are the ones who \nmake it. If they discover a new mineral with magical \nproperties, map a new land that's eminently suitable \nfor colonization, or uncover an ancient weapon with \nthe power to wreak devastation on your world, they \nare likely to set major events in motion. This gives \nthe players the opportunity to see exactly how much \ninfluence their actions have on your world. \nDecide on the type of discovery that is made or use \nthe Discoveries table to generate ideas. \nDISCOVERIES \ndl 0 \nDiscovery \nAncient ruinflost city of a legendary race \n2 \nAnimalfmonsterfmagical mutation \n3 \nlnventionftechnologyjmagic (helpful, destructive) \n4 \nNew (or forgotten) god or planar entity \n5 \nNew (or rediscovered) artifact or religious relic \n6 \nNew land (island, continent, lost world , demiplane) \n7 \nOtherworldly object (planar portal, alien spacecraft) \n8 \nPeople (race, tribe, lost civilization , colony) \n9 \nPlant (miracle herb, fungal parasite, sentient plant) \n10 \nResource or wealth (gold, gems, mithral) \nOnce you have determined the type of discovery, flesh \nit out by deciding exactly what it is, who discovered \nit, and what potential effect it could have on the \nworld.

  'text': '9. PREDICTION\' OMEN\' PROPHECY \nSometimes the foretelling of a world-shaking event \nbecomes a world-shaking event: an omen that predicts \nthe fall of empires, the doom of races, and the end \nof the world. Sometimes an omen points to change \nfor the good, such as the arrival of a legendary hero \nor savior. But the most dramatic prophecies warn of \nfuture tragedies and predict dark ages. Unlike other \nworld-shaking events, the outcome doesn\'t happen \nimmediately. Instead, individuals or factions strive to \nfulfill or avert the prophecy-or shape the exact way it \nwill be fulfilled- according to how it will affect them. \nThe prophecy\'s helpers or hinderers create adventure \nhooks in the campaign by the actions they take. A \nprophecy should foretell a big event on a grand scale, \nsince it will take time to come true (or be averted). \nImagine that a world-shaking prophecy comes to light. \nIf events continue on their present course, the prophecy \nwill come true and the world will change dramatically \nas a result. Don\'t shy away from making this prophecy \nboth significant and alarming, keeping in mind the \nfollowing points: \nCreate a prophecy that foretells a major change to \nthe campaign world. You can build one from scratch \nusing ideas from the current campaign or randomly \ndetermine a world-shaking event and fl~sh out \nthe details. \nWrite a list of three or more omens that will occur \nbefore the prophecy comes to pass. You can use \nevents that have already occurred in the campaign so \nthat the prophecy is closer to being fulfilled. The rest \nare events that might or might not happen, depending \non the actions of the characters. \nDescribe the person or creature that discovered \nthe prophecy and how it was found. What did this \ncreature gain by revealing it? What did this person \nlose or sacrifice? \n• Describe the individual or faction that supports the \nprophecy and works to ensure its fulfillment, and the \none that will do all in its power to avert the prophecy. \nWhat is the first step each takes? Who suffers for \ntheir efforts? \nOne part of the prophecy is wrong. Choose one of the \nomens you listed or one of the details you created for \nthe world-shaking event that the omen predicts. The \nchosen omen is false, and if applicable, its opposite is \ntrue instead. \n10. MYTH AND LEGEND \nIf wars, plagues, discoveries, and the like can be called \nregular world-shaking events, mythic events exceed \nand surpass them. A mythic event might occur as the \nfulfillment of an ancient or long-forgotten prophecy, or it \nmight be an act of divine intervention. \nOnce again, your current campaign probably provides \na few ideas for the shape of this event. If you need \ninspiration, roll a d8 on the World-Shaking Events table, \ninstead of the normal dlO. Address the bullet-point \nnotes for that disaster, but magnify the result to the \ngrandest scale you can imagine. \nCHAPTER 1 j A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \nThe rise or fall of a leader or era is the death or \nbirth of a god, or the end of an age or the world. A \ncataclysmic disaster is a world-drowning deluge, an ice \nage, or a zombie apocalypse. An assault or invasion is \na world war, a world-spanning demonic incursion, the \nawakening of a world-threatening monster, or the final \nclash between good and evil. A rebellion dethrones a \ngod or gods, or raises a new force (such as a demon \nlord) to divinity. A new organization is a world-spanning \nempire or a pantheon of new gods. A discovery is a \ndoomsday device or a portal to eldritch dimensions \nwhere world-shattering cosmic horrors dwell. \nTRACKING TIME \nA calendar lets you record the passage of time in the \ncampaign. More importantly, it lets you plan ahead for \nthe critical events that shake up the world. For simple \ntime tracking, use a calendar for the current year in \nthe real world. Pick a date to indicate the start of the \ncampaign, and make note of the days that adventurers \nspend on their travels and various activities. The \ncalendar tells you when the seasons change and \nthe lunar cycle. More importantly, you can use your \ncalendar to track important festivals and holidays, as \nwell as key events that shape your campaign. \nThis method is a good starting point, but the calendar \nof your world need not follow a modern calendar. If you \nwant to customize your calendar with details unique to \nyour world, consider these types of features. \nTHE BASICS \nA fantasy world\'s calendar doesn\'t have to mirror the \nmodern one, but it can (see "The Calendar of Harptos" \nsidebar for an example). Do the weeks of a month have \nnames? What about specific days of each month, like the \nides, nones, and calends of the Roman calendar? \nPHYSICAL CYCLES \nDetermine when the seasons fall, marked by the \nsolstices and equinoxes. Do the months correspond \nto the phases of the moon (or moons)? Do strange \nand magical effects occur at the same time as these \nphenomena? \nRELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES \nSprinkle holy days throughout your calendar. Each \nsignificant deity in your world should have at least one \nholy day during the year, and some gods\' holy days \ncorrespond to celestial phenomena such as new moons \nor equinoxes. Holy days reflect the portfolio of a deity (a \ngod of agriculture is honored in the harvest season) or \nsignificant events in the history of the deity\'s worship, \nsuch as the birth or death of a holy person, the date of \na god\'s manifestation, the accession of the current high \npriest, and so on. \nCertain holy days are civic events, observed by every \ncitizen of a town where a god\'s temple can be found. \nHarvest festivals are often celebrations on a grand \nscale. Other holy days are important only to people \nparticularly devoted to a single deity. Still others are \nobserved by priests, who perform private rites and \nsacrifices inside their temples on certain days or specific \n'},

  'text': 'times of day. And some holy days are local, observed by \ndle faithful of a specific temple. \nGive some thought to how priests and common folk \n-elebrate holy days. Going into a temple, sitting in a \npew, and listening to a sermon is a mode of worship \n"oreign to most fantasy religions. More commonly, \ncelebrants offer sacrifices to their gods. The faithful \nbring animals to the temple to be slaughtered or \nurn incense as an offering. The wealthiest citizens \noring the largest animals, to flaunt their wealth and \nemonstrate their piety. People pour out libations at the \ngraves of their ancestors. They spend all-night vigils in \ndarkened shrines or enjoy splendid feasts celebrating a \ngod\'s bounty. \nC IVIC OBSERVANCES \nHoly days provide the majority of the special \ncelebrations in most calendars, but local or national \n:estivals account for many others. The birthday of a \n:nonarch, the anniversary of a great victory in a war, \ncraft festivals, market days, and similar events all \n;&gt;rovide excuses for local celebrations. \nf ANTASTIC EVENTS \n-ince your setting is a fantasy world and not a mundane \n::nedieval society, add in a few events of an obviously \nmagical nature. For example, perhaps a ghostly castle \nappears on a certain hill on the winter solstice every \n_·ear, or every third full moon fills lycanthropes with a \nparticularly strong bloodlust. Also, the thirteenth night \nof every month could mark the ghostly wanderings of a \nong-forgotten nomadic tribe. \nExtraordinary events, such as the approach of a comet \nor a lunar eclipse, make good adventure elements, and \n:ou can drop them in your calendar wherever you want. \nYour calendar can tell you when there\'s a full moon for \na lunar eclipse, but you can always fudge the date for a \narticular effect. \nENDING A CAMPAIGN \nA campaign\'s ending should tie up all the threads of \nbeginning and middle, but you don\'t have to take a \ncampaign all the way to 20th level for it to be satisfying. \n.\\\'rap up the campaign whenever your story reaches its \natural conclusion. \n:Make sure you allow space and time near the end \nof your campaign for the characters to finish up any \npersonal goals. Their own stories need to end in \na atisfying way, just as the campaign story does. \ndeally, some of the characters\' individual goals will be \n:ulfilled by the ultimate goal of the final adventure. Give \nharacters with unfinished goals a chance to finish them \nbefore the very end. \nOnce the campaign has ended, a new one can begin. \nf you intend to run a new campaign for the same group \nof players, using their previous characters\' actions as \nr.he basis of legends gives them immediate investment in \ndle new setting. Let the new characters experience how \nme world has changed because of their old characters. \nn the end, though, the new campaign is a new story \n·ith new protagonists. They shouldn\'t have to share the \n-potlight with the heroes of days gone by. \nThe world of the Forgotten Realms uses the Calendar of \nHarptos, named after the long-dead wizard who invented \nit. Each year of 365 days is divided into twelve months of \nthirty days each, which roughly correspond to months in the \nreal-world Gregorian calendar. Each month is divided into \nthree tendays. Five special holidays fall between the months \nand mark the seasons. Another special holiday, Shieldmeet, \nis inserted into the calendar after Midwinter every four years, \nmuch like leap years in the modern Gregorian calendar. \nMonth \nName \nCommon Name \nHammer \nDeepwinter \nAnnual holiday: Midwinter \nQuadrennial holiday: Shield meet \n2 \nAlturiak \nThe Claw of Winter \n3 \nChes \nThe Claw of the Sunsets \n4 \nTarsakh \nThe Claw of the Storms \nAnnual holiday: Greengrass \n5 \nMirtul \nThe Melting \n6 \nKythorn \nThe Time of Flowers \n7 \nFlamerule \nSummertide \nAnnual holiday: Midsummer \n8 \nEleasias \nHighsun \n9 \nEleint \nThe Fading \nAnnual holiday: Highharvesttide \n10 \nMarpenoth \nLeaffall \n11 \nUktar \nThe Rotting \nAnnual holiday: The Feast of the Moon \n12 \nNightal \nThe Drawing Down \nCHAPTER l I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \n33 \n'},

  'text': '34 \nPLAY STYLE \nBy building a new world (or adopting an existing one) \nand creating the key events that launch your campaign, \nyou determined what your campaign is about. Next, you \nhave to decide how you want to run your campaign. \nWhat\'s the right way to run a campaign? That depends \non your play style and the motivations of your players. \nConsider your players\' tastes, your strengths as a \nDM, table rules (discussed in part 3), and the type of \ngame you want to run. Describe to the players how you \nenvision the game experience and let them give you \ninput. The game is theirs, too. Lay that groundwork \nearly, so your players can make informed choices and \nhelp you maintain the type of game you want to run. \nConsider the following two exaggerated examples of \nplay style. \nHACK AND SLASH \nThe adventurers kick in the dungeon door, fight the \nmonsters, and grab the treasure. This style of play is \nstraightforward, fun, exciting, and action-oriented. The \nplayers spend relatively little time developing personas \nfor their characters, roleplaying noncombat situations, \nor discussing anything other than the immediate \ndangers of the dungeon. \nIn such a game, the adventurers face clearly evil \nmonsters and opponents and occasionally meet clearly \ngood and helpful NPCs. Don\'t expect the adventurers \nto anguish over what to do with prisoners, or to debate \nwhether it\'s right or wrong to invade and wipe out a \nbugbear lair. Don\'t track money or time spent in town. \nOnce they\'ve completed a task, send the adventurers \nback into the action as quickly as possible. Character \nmotivation need be no more developed than a desire to \nkill monsters and acquire treasure. \nlMMERSIVE STORYTELLING \nWaterdeep is threatened by political turmoil. The \nadventurers must convince the Masked Lords, the city\'s \nsecret rulers, to resolve their differences, but can do so \nA WORLD TO EXPLORE \nMuch of a campaign involves the adventurers traveling from \nplace to place, exploring the environment, and learning \nabout the fantasy world. This exploration can take place in \nany environment, including a vast wilderness, a labyrinthine \ndungeon, the shadowy passages of the Underdark, the \ncrowded streets of a city, and the undulating waters of \nthe sea. Determining a way around an obstacle, finding a \nhidden object, investigating a strange feature of a dungeon, \ndeciphering clues, solving puzzles, and bypassing or \ndisabling traps can all be part of exploration. \nSometimes exploration is an incidental part of the game. \nFor instance, you might gloss over an unimportant journey \nby telling the players that they spend three uneventful days \non the road before moving along to the next point of interest. \nOther times exploration is the focus, a chance to describe \na wondrous part of the world or story that increases the \nplayers\' feeling of immersion. Similarly, you should consider \nplaying up exploration if your players enjoy solving puzzles, \nfinding their way around obstacles, and searching dungeon \ncorridors for secret doors. \nCHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \n,. \nonly after both the characters and the lords have come \nto terms with their differing outlooks and agendas. \nThis style of gaming is deep, complex, and challenging. \nThe focus isn\'t on combat but on negotiations, political \nmaneuverings, and character interaction. A whole game \nsession might pass without a single attack roll. \nIn this style of game, the NPCs are as complex and \nrichly detailed as the adventurers, although the focus \nlies on motivation and personality, not game statistics. \nExpect long digressions from each player about what \nhis or her character does, and why. Going to a temple to \nask a priest for advice can be as important an encounter \nas fighting orcs. (And don\'t expect the adventurers to \nfight the orcs at all unless they are motivated to do \nso.) A character will sometimes take actions against \nthe player\'s better judgment, because "that\'s what the \ncharacter would do." \nSince combat isn\'t the focus, game rules take a back \nseat to character development. Ability check modifiers \nand skill proficiencies take precedence over combat \nbonuses. Feel free to change or ignore rules to fit the \nplayers\' roleplaying needs, using the advice presented in \npart 3 of this book. \nSOMETHING IN BETWEEN \nThe style of play in most campaigns falls between these \ntwo extremes. There\'s plenty of action, but the campaign \noffers an ongoing storyline and interaction between \ncharacters as well. Players develop their characters\' \nmotivations and relish the chance to prove their skills \nin combat. To maintain the balance, provide a mixture \nof roleplaying encounters and combat encounters. Even \nin a dungeon setting, you can present NPCs that aren\'t \nmeant to be fought but rather helped out, negotiated \nwith, or just talked to. \nThink about your preferred style of play by \nconsidering these questions: \n• Are you a fan of realism and gritty consequences, or \nare you more focused on making the game seem like \nan action movie? \n• Do you want the game to maintain a sense of medieval \nfantasy, or do you want to explore alternate time lines \nor modern thinking? \nDo you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor \nyour goal? \n• Even if you are serious, is the action lighthearted \nor intense? \n• Is bold action key, or do the players need to be \nthoughtful and cautious? \nDo you like to plan thoroughly in advance, or do you \nprefer improvising on the spot? \n• Is the game full of varied D&amp;D elements, or does it \ncenter on a theme such as horror? \n• Is the game for all ages, or does it involve \nmature themes? \nAre you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as \nallowing the characters to explore whether the end \njustifies the means? Or are you happier with straight-\nforward heroic principles, such as justice, sacrifice, \nand helping the downtrodden? \n'},

  'text': 'CHARACTER NAMES \nPart of your campaign style has to do with naming \ncharacters. It\'s a good idea to establish some ground \nrules with your players at the start of a new campaign. \nIn a group consisting of Sithis, Travok, Anastrianna, \nand Kairon, the human fighter named Bob II sticks out, \nespecially when he\'s identical to Bob I, who was killed \nby kobolds. If everyone takes a lighthearted approach \nto names, that\'s fine. If the group would rather take the \ncharacters and their names a little more seriously, urge \nBob\'s player to come up with a more appropriate name. \nPlayer character names should match each other \nin flavor or concept, and they should also match the \nflavor of your campaign world-so should the non player \ncharacters\' names and place names you create. Travok \nand Kairon don\'t want to undertake a quest for Lord \nCupcake, visit Gumdrop Island, or take down a crazy \nwizard named Ray. \nCONTINUING OR \nEPISODIC CAMPAIGNS \nThe backbone of a campaign is a connected series \nof adventures, but you can connect them in two \ndifferent ways. \nIn a continuing campaign, the connected adventures \nshare a sense of a larger purpose or a recurring \ntheme (or themes). The adventures might feature \nreturning villains, grand conspiracies, or a single \nmastermind who\'s ultimately behind every adventure \nof the campaign. \nA continuing campaign designed with a theme and \na story arc in mind can feel like a great fantasy epic. \nThe players derive the satisfaction of knowing the \nactions they take during one adventure matter in the \nnext. Plotting and running that kind of campaign can \nbe demanding on the DM, but the payoff is a great and \nmemorable story. \nAn episodic campaign, in contrast, is like a television \nshow where each week\'s episode is a self-contained \nstory that doesn\'t play into any overarching plot. It \nmight be built on a premise that explains its nature: the \nplayer characters are adventurers-for-hire, or explorers \nventuring into the unknown and facing a string of \nunrelated dangers. They might even be archaeologists, \nventuring into one ancient ruin after another in search \nof artifacts. An episodic game like this lets you create \nadventures-or buy published ones- and drop them into \nyour campaign without worrying about how they fit with \nthe adventures that came before and follow after. \nCAMPAIGN THEME \nA theme in a campaign, as in a work of literature, \nexpresses the deeper meaning of a story and the \nfundamental elements of human experience that the \nstory explores. Your campaign doesn\'t have to be a work \nof literature, but it can still draw on common themes \nthat lend a distinctive flavor to its stories. Consider \nthese examples: \nCHAPTER I I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \nA campaign about confronting the inevitability of \nmortality, whether embodied in undead monsters or \nexpressed through the death of loved ones. \nA campaign revolving around an insidious evil, \nwhether dark gods, monstrous races such as the \nyuan-ti, or creatures of unknown realms far removed \nfrom mortal concerns. As heroes confront this evil, \nthey must face the selfish, cold tendencies of their own \nkind as well. \nA campaign featuring troubled heroes who confront \nnot only the savagery of the bestial creatures of the \nworld, but also the beast within- the rage and fury \nthat lies in their own hearts. \nA campaign exploring the insatiable thirst for power \nand domination, whether embodied by the hosts of the \nNine Hells or by humanoid rulers bent on conquering \nthe world. \nWith a theme such as "confrontation with mortality," \nyou can craft a broad range of adventures that aren\'t \nnecessarily connected by a common villain. One \nadventure might feature the dead bursting from their \ngraves and threatening to overwhelm a whole town. \nIn the next adventure, a mad wizard creates a flesh \ngolem in an effort to revive his lost love. A villain could \ngo to extreme lengths to achieve immortality to avoid \nconfronting its own demise. The adventurers might \nhelp a ghost accept death and move on, or one of the \nadventurers might even become a ghost! \nVARIATIONS ON A THEME \nMixing things up once in a while allows your players \nto enjoy a variety of adventures. Even a tightly themed \ncampaign can stray now and then. If your campaign \nheavily involves intrigue, mystery, and roleplaying, your \nplayers might enjoy the occasional dungeon crawl-\nespecially if the tangent is revealed to relate to a larger \nplot irr the campaign. If most of your adventures are \ndungeon expeditions, shift gears with a tense urban \nmystery that eventually leads the party into a dungeon \ncrawl in an abandoned building or tower. If you run \nhorror adventures week after week, try using a villain \nwho turns out to be ordinary, perhaps even silly. Comic \nrelief is a great variation on almost any D&amp;D campaign, \nthough players usually provide it themselves. \nTIERS OF PLAY \nAs characters grow in power, their ability to change the \nworld around them grows with them. It helps to think \nahead when creating your campaign to account for this \nchange. As the characters make a greater impact on the \nworld, they face greater danger whether they want to \nor not. Powerful factions see them as a threat and plot \nagainst them, while friendly ones court their favor in \nhopes of striking a useful alliance. \nThe tiers of play represent the ideal milestones for \nintroducing new world-shaking events to the campaign. \nAs the characters resolve one event, a new danger \narises or the prior trouble transforms into a new threat \nin response to the characters\' actions. Events.need to \ngrow in magnitude and scope, increasing the stakes and \ndrama as the characters become increasingly powerful. \n'},

  'text': "This approach also allows you to break your design \nwork down into smaller pieces. Create material such \nas adventures, NPCs, maps, and so on for one tier at \na time. You only need to worry about the details of the \nnext tier as the characters approach it. Even better, as \nthe campaign takes unexpected turns in response to the \nplayers' choices, you don't have to worry about redoing \nmuch work. \nLEVELS 1- 4: LOCAL HEROES \nCharacters in this tier are still learning the range of \nclass features that define them, including their choice \nof specialization. But even 1st-level characters are \nheroes, set apart from the common people by natural \ncharacteristics, learned skills, and the hint of a greater \ndestiny that lies before them. \nAt the start of their careers, characters use 1st-\nand 2nd-level spells and wield mundane gear. The \nmagic items they find include common consumable \nitems (potions and scrolls) and a very few uncommon \npermanent items. Their magic can have a big impact in \na single encounter, but it doesn't change the course of an \nadventure. \nThe fate of a village might hang on the success or \nfailure of low-level adventurers, who trust their lives \nto their fledgling abilities. These characters navigate \ndangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where \nthey can expect to fight savage orcs, ferocious wolves, \ngiant spiders, evil cultists, bloodthirsty ghouls, and \nhired thugs. If they face even a young dragon, they're \nbetter off avoiding a fight. \nLEVELS 5-10: HEROES OF THE REALM \nBy the time they reach this tier, adventurers have \nmastered the basics of their class features, though they \ncontinue to improve throughout these levels. They have \nfound their place in the world and have begun to involve \nthemselves in the dangers that surround them. \nDedicated spellcasters learn 3rd-level spells at the \nstart of this tier. Suddenly characters can fly, damage \nlarge numbers of foes with fireball and lightning bolt \npells, and even breathe underwater. They master \n5th-level spells by the end of the tier, and spells such \nas teleportation circle, scrying, flame strike, legend \nlore, and raise dead can have a significant impact on \ntheir adventures. They start acquiring more permanent \nmagic items (uncommon and rare ones) as well, which \nwill serve them for the rest of their careers. \nThe fate of a region might depend on the adventures \nthat characters of levels 5 to 10 undertake. These \nadventurers venture into fearsome wilds and ancient \nruins, where they confront savage giants, ferocious \nhydras, fearless golems, evil yuan-ti, scheming devils, \nbloodthirsty demons, crafty mind flayers, and drow \nassassins. They might have a chance of defeating a \nyoung dragon that has established a lair but not yet \nextended its reach far into the surrounding territory. \nLEVELS 11-16: MASTERS OF THE \nREALM \nBy 11th level, characters are shining examples of \ncourage and determination-true paragons in the world, \nset well apart from the masses. At this tier, adventurers \nare far more versatile than they were at lower levels, and \nthey can usually find the right tool for a given challenge. \nDedicated spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells \nat 11th level, including spells that completely change \nthe way adventurers interact with the world. Their big, \nflashy spells are significant in combat- disintegrate, \nblade barrier, and heal, for example- but behind-the-\nscenes spells such as word of recall, find the path, \ncontingency, teleport, and true seeing alter the way \nplayers approach their adventures. Each spell level after \nthat point introduces new effects with an equally large \nimpact. The adventurers find rare magic items (and very \nrare ones) that bestow similarly powerful abilities. \nThe fate of a nation or even the world depends on \nmomentous quests that such characters undertake. \nAdventurers explore uncharted regions and delve into \nlong-forgotten dungeons, where they confront terrible \nmasterminds of the lower planes, cunning rakshasas \nand beholders, and hungry purple worms. They might \nencounter and even defeat a powerful adult dragon \nthat has established a lair and a significant presence in \nthe world. \nAt this tier, adventurers make their mark on the \nworld in a variety of ways, from the consequences of \ntheir adventures to the manner in which they spend \ntheir hard-won treasure and exploit their well-deserved \nreputations. Characters of this level construct fortresses \non land deeded them by local rulers. They found guilds, \ntemples, or martial orders. They take on apprentices \nor students of their own. They broker peace between \nnations or lead them into war. And their formidable \nreputations attract the attention of very powerful foes. \nLEVELS 17-20: MASTERS OF THE \nWORLD \nBy 17th level, characters have superheroic capabilities, \nand their deeds and adventures are the stuff of legend. \nOrdinary people can hardly dream of such heights of \npower-or such terrible dangers. \nDedicated spellcasters at this tier wield earthshaking \n9th-level spells such as wish, gate, storm of vengeance, \nand astral projection. Characters have several rare \nand very rare magic items at their disposal, and begin \ndiscovering legendary items such as a vorpal sword or a \nstaff of the magi. \nAdventures at these levels have far-reaching \nconsequences, possibly determining the fate of \nmillions in the Material Plane and even places beyond. \nCharacters traverse otherworldly realms and explore \ndemiplanes and other extraplanar locales, where they \nfight savage bator demons, titans, archdevils, lich \narchmages, and even avatars of the gods themselves. \nThe dragons they encounter are wyrms of tremendous \npower, whose sleep troubles kingdoms and whose \nwaking threatens existence itself. \nCHAPTER l I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN \n37 \n"},

These powerful characters might \nbe called on to undertake grand adventures on the \ncosmic stage. And as a result of these adventures, their \ncapabilities can continue to evolve. Characters gain no \nmore levels at this point, but they can still advance in \nmeaningful ways and continue performing epic deeds \nthat resound throughout the multiverse. Chapter 7 \ndetails epic boons you can use as rewards for these \ncharacters to maintain a sense of progress. \nSTARTING AT HIGHER LEVEL -----\nExperienced players familiar with the capabilities of \nthe character classes and impatient for more significant \nadventures might welcome the idea of starting a \ncampaign with characters above 1st level. Creating a \nhigher-level character uses the same character creation \nsteps outlined in the Player\'s Handbook. Such a \ncharacter has more hit points, class features, and spells, \nand probably starts with better equipment. \nStarting equipment for characters above 1st level is \nentirely at your discretion, since you give out treasure \nat your own pace. That said, you can use the Starting \nEquipment table as a guide. \nSTARTING EQUIPMENT \nFLAVORS OF FANTASY \nDUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS is a fantasy game, but that broad \ncategory encompasses a lot of variety. Many different \nflavors of fantasy exist in fiction and film. Do you want \na horrific campaign inspired by the works of H. P. \nLovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith? Or do you envision a \nworld of muscled barbarians and nimble thieves, along \nthe lines of the classic sword-and-sorcery books by \nRobert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber? Your choice can \nhave a impact on the flavor of your campaign. \nHEROIC FANTASY \n~~------------------\nHeroic fantasy is the baseline assumed by the D&amp;D \nrules. The Player\'s Handbook describes this baseline: \na multitude of humanoid races coexist with humans in \nfantastic worlds. Adventurers bring magical powers to \nbear against the monstrous threats they face. These \ncharacters typically come from ordinary backgrounds, \nbut something impels them into an adventuring life. The \nadventurers are the "heroes" of the campaign, but they \nmight not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for \nselfish reasons. Technology and society are based on \nmedieval norms, though the culture isn\'t necessarily \nEuropean. Campaigns often revolve around delving into \nancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort to \ndestroy monsters or villains. \nThis genre is also common in fantasy fiction. Most \nnovels set in the Forgotten Realms are best described as \nheroic fantasy, following in the footsteps of many of the \nauthors listed in appendix E of the Player\'s Handbook. \nSwoRD AND SoRCERY \nA grim, hulking fighter disembowels the high priest \nof the serpent god on his own altar. A laughing rogue \nspends ill-gotten gains on cheap wine in filthy taverns. \nHardy adventurers venture into the unexplored jungle in \nsearch of the fabled City of Golden Masks. \nA sword-and-sorcery campaign emulates some of the \nclassic works of fantasy fiction, a tradition that goes \nback to the roots of the game.

These characters \n-e heroes in the best sense, driven by a higher \nose than selfish gain or ambition, and facing \n~credible dangers without blinking. Characters \n~·ght struggle with moral quandaries, fighting \ne evil tendencies within themselves as well as \n-e evil that threatens the world. And the stories of \n-e e campaigns often include an element of romance: \n;agic affairs between star-crossed lovers, passion that \n:anscends even death, and chaste adoration between \n-\n·out knights and the monarchs and nobles they serve. \nThe novels of the Dragon lance saga exemplify the \n::adition of epic fantasy in D&amp;D. \n_ fYTHIC FANTASY \nnile an angry god tries time and again to destroy him, \nclever rogue makes the long journey home from war. \n3.-aving the terrifying guardians of the underworld, a \n- ble warrior ventures into the darkness to retrieve the \n: ul of her lost love.

  'text': "DARK FANTASY \nVampires brood on the battlements of their accursed \ncastles. Necromancers toil in dark dungeons to create \nhorrid servants made of dead flesh. Devils corrupt the \ninnocent, and werewolves prowl the night. All of these \nelements evoke horrific aspects of the fantasy genre. \nIf you want to put a horror spin on your campaign, \nyou have plenty of material to work with. The Monster \nManual is full of creatures that perfectly suit a storyline \nof supernatural horror. The most important element of \nsuch a campaign, though, isn't covered by the rules. A \ndark-fantasy setting requires an atmosphere of building \ndread, created through careful pacing and evocative \ndescription. Your players contribute too; they have to \nbe willing to embrace the mood you're trying to evoke. \nWhether you want to run a full-fledged dark-fantasy \ncampaign or a single creepy adventure, you should \ndiscuss your plans with the players ahead of time to \nmake sure they're on board. Horror can be intense \nand personal, and not everyone is comfortable with \nsuch a game. \nNovels and game products set in Ravenloft, the \nDemiplane of Dread, explore dark-fantasy elements in a \nD&amp;D context. \nINTRIGUE \nThe corrupt vizier schemes with the baron's oldest \ndaughter to assassinate the baron. A hobgoblin army \nsends doppelganger spies to infiltrate the city before the \ninvasion. At the embassy ball, the spy in the royal court \nmakes contact with his employer. \nPolitical intrigue, espionage, sabotage, and similar \ncloak-and-dagger activities can provide the basis for \nan exciting D&amp;D campaign. In this kind of game, the \ncharacters might care more about skill training and \nmaking contacts than about attack spells and magic \nweapons. Roleplaying and social interaction take on \ngreater importance than combat, and the party might go \nfor several sessions without seeing a monster. \nAgain, make sure your players know ahead of time \nthat you want to run this kind of campaign. Otherwise, \na player might create a defense-focused dwarf paladin, \nonly to find he is out of place among half-elf diplomats \nand tiefling spies. \nThe Brimstone Angels novels by Erin M. Evans focus \non intrigue in the Forgotten Realms setting, from the \nbackstabbing politics of the Nine Hells to the contested \ns_uccession of Cormyrean royalty. \nMYSTERY \nWho stole three legendary magic weapons and hid them \naway in a remote dungeon, leaving a cryptic clue to their \nlocation? Who placed the duke into a magical slumber, \nand what can be done to awaken him? Who murdered \nthe guildmaster, and how did the killer get into the \nguild's locked vault? \nA mystery-themed campaign puts the characters in \nthe role of investigators, perhaps traveling from town \nto town to crack tough cases the local authorities can't \nhandle. Such a campaign emphasizes puzzles and \nproblem-solving in addition to combat prowess. \nA larger mystery might even set the stage for the \nwhole campaign. Why did someone kill the characters' \nmentor, setting them on the path of adventure? Who \nreally controls the Cult of the Red Hand? In this case, \nthe characters might uncover clues to the greater \nmystery only once in a while; individual adventures \nmight be at best tangentially related to that theme. A \ndiet of nothing but puzzles can become frustrating, so \nbe sure to mix up the kinds of encounters you present. \nNovels in various D&amp;D settings have explored the \nmystery genre with a fantasy twist. In particular, Murder \nin Cormyr (by Chet Williamson), Murder in Halruaa (by \nRichard S. Meyers), and Spellstorm (by Ed Greenwood) \nare mysteries set in the Forgotten Realms. Murder \nin Tarsis (by John Maddox Roberts) takes the same \napproach in the Dragonlance setting. \nSWASHBUCKLING \nRapier-wielding sailors fight off boarding sahuagin. \nGhouls lurk in derelict ships, waiting to devour treasure \nhunters. Dashing rogues and charming paladins weave \ntheir way through palace intrigues and leap from \nbalconies onto waiting horses below. \nThe swashbuckling adventures of pirates and \nmusketeers suggest opportunities for a dynamic \ncampaign. The characters typically spend more \ntime in cities, royal courts, and seafaring vessels \nthan in dungeon delves, making interaction skills \nimportant (though not to the extent of a pure intrigue \ncampaign). Nevertheless, the heroes might end up in \nclassic dungeon situations, such as searching storm \nsewers beneath the palace to find the evil duke's \nhidden chambers. \nA good example of a swashbuckling rogue in the \nForgotten Realms is Jack Ravenwild, who appears in \nnovels by Richard Baker (City of Ravens and Prince \nof Ravens). \nWAR \nA hobgoblin army marches toward the city, leading \nelephants and giants to batter down the stronghold's \nwalls and ramparts. Dragons wheel above a barbarian \nhorde, scattering enemies as the raging warriors \ncut a swath through field and forest.

They are the spheres where celestials, fiends, \n-\ndeities exist. The plane of Elysium, for example, \n-merely a place where good creatures dwell, and not \nimply the place where spirits of good creatures \n. hen they die. It is the plane of goodness, a spiritual \nwhere evil can't flourish. It is as much a state of \n-\na and of mind as it is a physical location. \ne Inner Planes exemplify the physical essence \n- elemental nature of air, earth, fire, and water. \n--\nElemental Plane of Fire, for example, embodies \n~ e ence of fire. The plane's entire substance is \n= ed with the fundamental nature of fire: energy, \n--·on, transformation, and destruction. Even objects \n: lid brass or basalt seem to dance with flame, in a \nilile and palpable manifestation of the vibrancy of \n· dominion. \n- lhis context, the Material Plane is the nexus where \n· ese philosophical and elemental forces collide in \n:umbled existence of mortal life and matter. The \n- d of D&amp;D exist within the Material Plane, making \ne starting point for most campaigns and adventures. \n- -e rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the \n.,-erial Plane. \nl: ..... A.NAR CATEGORIES \n- -e planes of the default D&amp;D cosmology are grouped \n- -:he following categories: \ne Material Plane and Its Echoes. The Feywild and \n·· e Shadowfell are reflections of the Material Plane. \ne Transitive Planes. The Ethereal Plane and the \n. · tral Plane are mostly featureless planes that \n: rve primarily as pathways to travel from one plane \n•o another. \nThe Inner Planes. The four Elemental Planes (Air, \nEarth, Fire, and Water), plus the Elemental Chaos that \nsurrounds them, are the Inner Planes. \nThe Outer Planes. Sixteen Outer Planes correspond \nto the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of \nphilosophical difference between them. \nThe Positive and Negative Planes. These two planes \nenfold the rest of the cosmology, providing the raw \nforces of life and death that underlie the rest of \nexistence in the multiverse. \nPUTTING THE PLANES TOGETHER \nAs described in the Player's Handbook, the assumed \nD&amp;D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes. \nFor your campaign, you decide what planes to include, \ninspired by the standard planes, drawn from Earth's \nmyths, or created by your own imagination. \nAt minimum, most D&amp;D campaigns require \nthese elements: \n• A plane of origin for fiends \nA plane of origin for celestials \nA plane of origin for elementals \n• A place for deities, which might include any or all of \nthe previous three \nThe place where mortal spirits go after death, which \nmight include any or all of the first three \nA way of getting from one plane to another \nA way for spells and monsters that use the Astral \nPlane and the Ethereal Plane to function \nOnce you've decided on the planes you want to use in \nyour campaign, putting them into a coherent cosmology \nis an optional step. Since the primary way of traveling \nfrom plane to plane, even using the Transitive Planes, \nis through magical portals that link planes together, the \nexact relationship of different planes to one another is \nlargely a theoretical concern. No being in the multiverse \ncan look down and see the planes in their arrangement \nthe same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No \nmortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched \nbetween Bytopia and Arcadia, but it's a convenient \ntheoretical construct based on the philosophical \nshading among the three planes and the relative \nimportance they give to law and good. \nSages have constructed a few such theoretical models \nto make sense of the jumble of planes, particularly the \nOuter Planes. The three most common are the Great \nINVENTING YOUR OWN PLANES \nEach of the planes described in this chapter has at least \none significant effect on travelers who venture there.

  'text': 'Wheel, the World Tree, and the World Axis, but you \ncan create or adapt whatever model works best for the \nplanes you want to use in your game. \nTHE GREAT WHEEL \nThe default cosmological arrangement presented \nin the Player\'s Handbook visualizes the planes as a \ngroup of concentric wheels, with the Material Plane \nand its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form \na wheel around the Material Plane, enveloped in the \nEthereal Plane. Then the Outer Planes form another \nwheel around and behind (or above or below) that one, \narranged according to alignment, with the Outlands \nlinking them all. \nThis arrangement makes sense of the way the River \nStyx flows among the Lower Planes, connecting \nAcheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the \nAbyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a string. But it\'s \nnot the only possible explanation of the river\'s course. \nTHE WORLD TREE \nA different arrangement of planes envisions them \nsituated among the roots and branches of a great cosmic \ntree, literally or figuratively. \nFor example, the Norse cosmology centers on the \nWorld Tree Yggdrasil. The three roots of the World \nTree touch the three realms: Asgard (an Outer Plane \nthat includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other \nregions), Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim \n(the underworld). The Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, \nis a unique transitive plane that connects Asgard \nand Midgard. \nSimilarly, one vision of the planes where the deities \nof the Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of \ncelestial planes in the branches of a World Tree, while \nthe fiendish planes are linked by a River of Blood. \nNeutral planes stand apart from them. Each of these \nplanes is primarily the domain of one or more deities, \nthough they are also the homes of celestial and fiendish \ncreatures. \nTHE WORLD AxiS \nIn this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its \nechoes stand between two opposing realms. The Astral \nPlane (or Astral Sea) floats above them, holding any \nnumber of divine domains (the Outer Planes). Below \nthe Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single, \nundifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements \nclash together. At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is \nthe Abyss, like a hole torn in the fabric of the cosmos. \nOTHER VISIONS \nAs you build your own cosmology, consider the \nfollowing alternatives. \nThe Omniverse. This simple cosmology covers the \nbare minimum: a Material Plane; the Transitive Planes; \na single Elemental Chaos; an Overheaven, where good-\naligned deities and celestials live; and the Underworld, \nwhere evil deities and fiends live. \nMyriad Planes. In this cosmology, countless planes \nclump together like soap bubbles, intersecting with each \nother more or less at random. \nCHAPTER 2 I CREATING A Mt.:LTI\\ ERSE \nThe Orrery. All the Inner and Outer Planes orbit the \nMaterial Plane, exerting greater or lesser influence on \nthe world as they come nearer and farther. The world of \nEberron uses this cosmological model. \nThe Winding Road. In this cosmology, every plane is \na stop along an infinite road. Each plane is adjacent to \ntwo others, but there\'s no necessary cohesion between \nadjacent planes; a traveler can walk from the slopes of \nMount Celestia onto the slopes of Gehenna. \nMount Olympus. In the Greek cosmology, Mount \nOlympus stands at the center of the world (the Material \nPlane), with its peak so high that it\'s actually another \nplane of existence: Olympus, the home of the gods. All \nthe Greek gods except Hades have their own domains \nwithin Olympus. In Hades, named for its ruler, mortal \nsouls linger as insubstantial shades until they eventually \nfade into nothing. Tartarus, where the titans are \nimprisoned in endless darkness, lies below Hades. And \nfar to the west of the known world in the Material Plane \nare the blessed Elysian Fields. The souls of great heroes \nreside there. \nSolar Barge. The Egyptian cosmology is defined by \nthe daily path of the sun- across the sky of the Material \nPlane, down to the fair Offering Fields in the west, \nwhere the souls of the righteous live in eternal reward, \nand then beneath the world through the nightmarish \nTwelve Hours of Night. The Solar Barge is a tiny Outer \nPlane in its own right, though it exists within the Astral \nPlane and the other Outer Planes in the different stages \nof its journey. \nOne World. In this model, there are no other \nplanes of existence, but the Material Plane includes \nplaces like the bottomless Abyss, the shining Mount \nCelestia, the strange city of Mechanus, the fortress of \nAcheron, and so on. All the planes are locations in the \nwodd, reachable by ordinary means of travel-though \nextraordinary effort is required, for example, to sail \nacross the sea to the blessed isles of Elysium. \nThe Otherworld. In this model, the Material Plane \nhas a twin realm that fills the role of all the other planes. \nMuch like the Feywild, it overlays the Material Plane \nand can be reached through "thin places" where the \nworlds are particularly close: through caves, by sailing \nfar across the sea, or in fairy rings in remote forests. It \nhas dark, evil regions (homes of fiends and evil gods), \nsacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits of the \nblessed death), and realms of elemental fury. This \notherworld is sometimes overseen by an eternal city, or \nby four cities that each represent a different aspect of \nreality. The Celtic cosmology has an otherworld, called \nTfr na n6g, and the cosmologies of some religions \ninspired by Asian myth have a similar Spirit World. \nPLANAR TRAVEL \nWhen adventurers travel to other planes of existence, \nthey undertake a legendary journey that might force \nthem to face supernatural guardians and undergo \nvarious ordeals. The nature of that journey and the trials \nalong the way depend in part on the means of travel, and \nwhether the adventurers find a magic portal or use a \nspell to carry them. \n'},

Most of the time, though, a \n:tal presents an adventure in itself. \n:=-\nt. the adventurers must find a portal that leads \nere they want to go. Most portals exist in distant \nations, and a portal\'s location often has thematic \n- arities to the plane it leads to. For example, a portal \n- e heavenly mountain of Celestia might be located \na mountain peak. \n- cond, portals often have guardians charged with \nillfing that undesirable people don\'t pass through. \n:;&gt;ending on the portal\'s destination, "undesirable \n- pie·· might include evil characters, good characters, \n:ards, thieves, anyone wearing a robe, or any mortal \n-e ture.

A portal can have any conceivable \n- ement, but the following are the most common: \ne. The portal functions only at particular times: \nilfing a full moon on the Material Plane, or every ten \ny . or when the stars are in a particular position. \nnee it opens, such a portal remains open for a \nired time, such as for three days following the full \n~n . or for an hour, or for ld4 + 1 rounds. \n--\nation. The portal functions only if a particular \nondition is met. A situation-keyed portal opens \non a clear night, or when it rains, or when a certain \nspell is cast in its vicinity . \nRandom. A random portal functions for a random \nperiod, then shuts down for a similarly random \nduration. Typically, such a portal allows ld6 + \n6 travelers to pass through, then shuts down \nfor ld6 days. \nCommand Word. The portal functions only if a \nparticular command word is spoken. Sometimes the \nword must be spoken as a character passes through \nthe portal (which is otherwise a mundane doorway, \nwindow, or similar opening). Other portals open when \nthe command word is spoken and remain open for a \nshort time. \nKey. The portal functions if the traveler is holding a \nparticular object; the item acts much like a key to \nll. door. This key item can be a common object or a \nparticular key created for that portal. The city of Sigil \nabove the Outlands is known as the City of Doors \nbecause it features an overwhelming number of such \nitem-keyed portals. \nLearning and meeting a portal\'s requirements can \ndraw characters into further adventures as they chase \ndown a key item, scour old libraries for command \nwords, or consult sages to find the right time \nto visit the portal. \n'},

  'text': 'SPELLS \nSa~ya raised her hands and began to declaim the words of \na very powerful spell, one of the most dangerous she knew, \na spell designed to breach the barriers between the planes \nand create a magical bridge into another realm of existence. \nThe myth a/ thrummed in response, the intangible pulse of \nthe old device taking on a new and different note. Sarya \nignored the myth a/ stone\'s change and pressed on, finishing \nher gate spell with skill and confidence. \n"The gate is open!" she cried. "Malkizid, come forth !" \nBefore Sarya a great ring or hoop of golden magic \ncoalesced from the air. Through it she glimpsed the realm \nof Malkizid, an infernal wasteland of parched desert, \nwindswept rifts, and black, angry skies torn by crimson \nlightning. Then , through the gate, the archdevil Malkizid \nappeared. With one smooth step he crossed from his \ninfernal plane into the myth a/ chamber. \n-Richard Baker, Farthest Reach \nA number of spells allow direct or indirect access to \nother planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can \ndirectly transport adventurers to any other plane, with \ndifferent degrees of precision. Etherealness allows \nadventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the astral \nprojection spell lets adventurers project themselves \ninto the Astral Plane and from there travel to the \nOuter Planes. \nPlane Shift. The plane shift spell has two important \nlimitations. The first is the material component: a \nsmall, forked, metal rod (like a tuning fork) attuned to \nthe desired planar destination. The spell requires the \nproper resonating frequency to home in on the correct \nlocation, and the fork must be made of the right material \n(sometimes a complex alloy) to focus the spell\'s magic \nproperly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250 gp), \nbut even the act of researching the correct specifications \ncan lead to adventure. After all. not many people \nvoluntarily travel into the depth of Carceri, so very few \nknow what kind of tuning fork i required to get there. \nSecond, the spell doesn\'t end the caster to a specific \nlocation unless he or she ha \npecialized information. \nThe sigil sequence of a teleponation circle located on \nanother plane allows the ca rer ro travel directly to that \nCHAPTER 2 I CREATING A \nE \ncircle, but such knowledge is even harder to come \nby than the specifications of the required tuning \nfork. Otherwise, the spell transports the caster to \na location in the general vicinity of the desired spot. \nWherever the adventurers arrive, they\'ll most likely \nstill need to undertake a journey to reach the object of a \nplanar quest. \nGate. The gate spell opens a portal linked to a specific \npoint on another plane of existence. The spell provides \na shortcut to a planar destination, bypassing many of \nthe guardians and trials that would normally fill such \na journey. But this 9th-level spell is out of reach for all \nbut the most powerful characters, and it does nothing to \nnegate any obstacles that wait at the destination. \nThe gate spell is powerful, but not infallible. A deity, \ndemon lord, or other powerful entity can prevent such a \nportal from opening within its dominion. \nASTRAL PLANE \nHalisstra opened her eyes and found herself drifting in \nan endless silver sea. Soft gray clouds moved slowly in \nthe distance, while strange dark streaks twisted violently \nthrough the sky, anchored in ends so distant she couldn\'t \nperceive them, their middle parts revolving angrily like \npieces of string rolled between a child\'s fingertips. She \nglanced down, wondering what supported her, and saw \nnothing but more of the strange pearly sky beneath her feet \nand all around her. \nShe drew in a sudden breath, surprised by the sight, and \nfelt her lungs fill with something sweeter and perhaps a little \nmore solid than air, but instead of gagging or drowning \non the stuff she seemed perfectly acclimated to it. An \nelectric thrill raced through her limbs as she found herself \nmesmerized by the simple act of respiration. \n-Richard Baker, Condemnatio \nThe Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, \nwhere visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach \nthe Outer Planes.

Much more commonplace are color pools-\nmagical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant, \nspinning coins. \nCreatures on the Astral Plane don't age or suffer from \nhunger or thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live \non the Astral Plane (such as the githyanki) establish \noutposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so \ntheir children can grow to maturity. \nA traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply \nthinking about moving, but distance has little meaning. \nIn combat, though, a creature's walking.speed (in feet) is \nequal to 3 x its Intelligence score. The smarter a creature \nis, the easier it can control its movement by act of will. \nASTRAL PROJECTION \nTraveling through the Astral Plane by means of \nthe astral projection spell involves projecting one's \nconsciousness there, usually in search of a gateway to an \nOuter Plane to visit. Since the Outer Planes are as much \nspiritual states of being as they are physical places, this \nallows a character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he \nor she had physically traveled there, but as in a dream. \nA character's death-either in the Astral Plane or on \nthe destination plane-causes no actual harm. Only the \nsevering of a character's silver cord while on the Astral \nPlane (or the death of his or her helpless physical body \non the Material Plane) can result in the character's true \ndeath. Thus, high-level characters sometimes travel to \nthe Outer Planes by way of astral projection rather than \neek out a portal or use a more direct spell. \nOnly a few things can sever a traveler's silver cord, the \nmost common being a psychic wind (described below). \nThe legendary silver swords of the githyanki also have \nthis ability. A character who travels bodily to the Astral \nPlane (by means of the plane shift spell or one of the \n.-are portals that leads directly there) has no silver cord. \nC OLOR POOLS \nGateways leading from the Astral Plane to other \nplanes appear as two-dimensional pools of rippling \ncolors, ld6 x 10 feet in diameter. Traveling to another \nplane requires locating a color pool that leads to the \ndesired plane. These gateways to other planes can be \n:dentified by color, as shown on the Astral Color Pools \ntable.

After a few rounds, the area becomes \nas dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the \ntraveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself \nwas rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes, \nthe psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal \nin a few rounds. \nThe psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a \nlocation effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers \njourneying together suffers the same location effect. \nEach traveler affected by the wind must also make a \nDC 15 Intelligence saving throw.

Rival en \nand Brenn us stood beside him. \n"The ethereal plane," Rivalen said. "The dragon\'s breath \ncannot affect us here." \n- PaulS. Kemp, Shadowstorm \nThe Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension. \nIts "shores," called the Border Ethereal, overlap the \nMaterial Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every \nlocation on those planes has a corresponding location \non the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the Border Ethereal \nis limited to 60 feet The plane\'s depths comprise a \nregion of swirling mist and fog called the Deep EthereaL \nwhere visibility is limited to 30 feet \nCharacters can use the etherealness spell to enter \nthe Border EthereaL The plane shift spell allows \ntransport to the Border Ethereal or the Deep Ethereal, \nbut unless the intended destination is a specific location \nor a teleportation circle, the point of arrival could be \nanywhere on the plane. \nBORDER ETHEREAL \n------\nFrom the Border Ethereal, a traveler can see into \nwhatever plane it overlaps, but that plane appears muted \nand indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and \nits edges turning fuzzy. Ethereal denizens watch the \nplane as though peering through distorted and frosted \nglass, and can\'t see anything beyond 30 feet into the \nother plane. Conversely, the Ethereal Plane is usually \ninvisible to those on the overlapped planes, except with \nthe aid of magic. \n-Normally, creatures in the Border Ethereal can\'t \nattack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice \nversa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and \nutterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and \nsolid objects on the overlapped plane don\'t hamper \nthe movement of a creature in the Border EthereaL \nThe exceptions are certain magical effects (including \nanything made of magical force) and living beings. This \nmakes the Ethereal Plane ideal for reconnaissance, \nspying on opponents, and moving around without being \ndetected. The Ethereal Plane also disobeys the laws \nof gravity; a creature there can move up and down as \neasily as walking. \nDEEP ETHEREAL \n-------\nTo reach the Deep Ethereal, one needs a plane shift \nspell or arrive by means of a gate spell or magical portaL \nVisitors to the Deep Ethereal are engulfed by roiling \nmist Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of \nvaporous color, and passing through a curtain leads a \ntraveler to a region of the Border Ethereal connected to \na specific Inner Plane, the Material Plane, the Feywild. \nor the ShadowfelL The color of the curtain indicates the \nplane whose Border Ethereal the curtain conceals; see \nthe Ethereal Curtains table. \n'},

Each character in a \ngroup traveling together must make a DC 15 Charisma \naving throw. If at least half the group succeeds, travel \nis delayed by 1d10 hours. Otherwise, the journey's travel \ntime is doubled. Less often, a group is blown into the \nBorder Ethereal of a random plane. Rarely, the cyclone \nrears a hole in the fabric of the plane and hurls the party \ninto the Astral Plane. \nE THEREAL PLANE ENCOUNTERS \n_lost encounters in the Border Ethereal are with \neatures on the Material Plane whose senses or \nabilities extend into the Ethereal Plane (phase spiders, \n:or example). Ghosts also move freely between the \n:=:rhereal and Material Planes. \nIn the Deep Ethereal, most encounters are with other \n~velers , particularly ones from the Inner Planes (such \n...: elementals, genies, and salamanders), as well as the \n- casional celestial, fiend, or fey. \nFEYWILD \nStepping into the portal was like settling into a warm bath, \nthough the chill didn't jade from the air. At first everything \nmuted-the roar of the river around the rocks below, the \nchirping of frogs and crickets on shore, the evening bustle of \nthe town behind him . ... A moment later, the world erupted \ninto vibrant life. Frogs and night birds sang a chorus; the air \nwas awash with autumn scents; the moonlight painted the \nflowers in iridescent blue, silver, and violet; and the rushing \nof the river became a complex symphony. \n-James Wyatt, Oath of Vigilance \nThe Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of \nsoft lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is a \nrealm of everlasting twilight, with glittering faerie lights \nbobbing in the gentle breeze and fat fireflies buzzing \nthrough groves and fields. The sky is alight with the \nfaded colors of an ever-setting sun, which never truly \nsets (or rises for that matter); it remains stationary, \ndusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas \nruled by the seelie fey that compose the Summer Court, \nthe land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles and \nsyrupy fens- perfect territory for the unseelie fey to hunt \ntheir prey. \nThe Feywild exists in parallel to the Material \nPlane, an alternate dimension that occupies the same \ncosmological space. The landscape of the Feywild \nmirrors the natural world but turns its features into \nspectacular forms. Where a volcano stands on the \nMaterial Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper-\nsized crystals that glow with internal fire towers in the \nFeywild. A wide and muddy river on the Material Plane \nmight be echoed as a clear and winding brook of great \nbeauty. A marsh could be reflected as a vast black bog of \nsinister character. And moving to the Feywild from old \nruins on the Material Plane might put a traveler at the \ndoor of an arch fey's castle. \nThe Feywild is inhabited by sylvan creatures, such \nas elves, dryads, satyrs, pixies, and sprites, as well as \ncentaurs and magical creatures such as blink dogs, \nfaerie dragons, treants, and unicorns. The darker \nregions of the plane are home to such malevolent \ncreatures as hags, blights, goblins, ogres, and giants. \nSEELIE AND UNSEELIE FEY \nTwo queens hold court in the Feywild, and most fey owe \nallegiance to one or the other. Queen Titania and her \nSummer Court lead the seelie fey, and the Queen of Air and \nDarkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court, leads the unseelie fey. \nSeelie and unseelie do not directly correlate with good and \nevil, though many mortals make that equation. Many seelie \nfey are good, and many unseelie are evil, but their opposition \nto each other stems from their queens' jealous rivalry, not \nabstract moral concerns. Ugly denizens of the Feywild, such \nas fomorians and hags, are almost never members of either \ncourt, and fey of independent spirit reject the courts entirely. \nThe courts have warred at times, but they also compete in \nmore-or-less friendly contests and even ally with one another \nin small and secret ways. \nCHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE \n49 \n"},

  'text': "so \nFEY CROSSINGS \nFey crossings are places of mystery and beauty on the \nMaterial Plane that have a near-perfect mirror in the \nFeywild, creating a portal where the two planes touch. \nA traveler passes through a fey crossing by entering a \nclearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of \nmushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. To \nthe traveler, it seems like he or she has simply walked \ninto the Feywild with a step. To an observer, the traveler \nis there one moment and gone the next. \nLike other portals between planes, most fey crossings \nopen infrequently. A crossing might open only during \na full moon, on the dawn of a particular day, or for \nsomeone carrying a certain type of item. A fey crossing \ncan be closed permanently if the land on either side is \ndramatically altered- for example, if a castle is built \nover the clearing on the Material Plane. \nOPTIONAL RULES: FEYWILD MAGIC \nTales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures \nand spirited away to the Feywild, only to return to their \nparents years later without having aged a day, and \nwith no memories of their captors or the realm they \ncame from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an \nexcursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover \nupon their return that time flows differently on the \nPlane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit \nare hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the \nstrange magic that suffuses the plane. \nCHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTTVERSE \nMEMORY LOSS \nA creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC \n10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically \nsucceed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like \nelves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that \nfails the saving throw remembers nothing from its \ntime spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the \ncreature's memories remain intact but are a little hazy. \nAny spell that can end a curse can restore the creature's \nlost memories. \nTIME WARP \nWhile time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, \ncharacters might spend a day there and realize, upon \nleaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed \neverywhere else in the multiverse. \nWhenever a creature or group of creatures leaves \nthe Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane, \nyou can choose a time change that works best for your \ncampaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp \ntable. A wish spell can be used to remove the effect on \nup to ten creatures.

Reid, The Gossamer Plain \nThe Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material \nPlane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental \nsubstance from which all worlds were made. The four \nElemental Planes- Air, Earth, Fire, and Water- form \na ring around the Material Plane, suspended within \na churning realm known as the Elemental Chaos. \nThese planes are all connected, and the border regions \nbetween them are sometimes described as distinct \nplanes in their own right. \nAt their innermost edges, where they are closest \nto the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal \ngeographical sense), the four Elemental Planes \nresemble places in the Material Plane. The four \nelements mingle together as they do in the Material \nPlane, forming land, sea, and sky. But the dominant \nelement exerts a strong influence on the environment, \nreflecting its fundamental qualities. \nThe inhabitants of this inner ring include aarakocra, \nazers, dragon turtles, gargoyles, genies, mephits, \nsalamanders, and xorn. Some originated on the \nMaterial Plane, and all can travel to the Material \nPlane (if they have access to the magic required) and \nsurvive there. \nAs. they extend farther from the Material Plane, \nthe Elemental Planes become increasingly alien and \nhostile. Here, in the outermost regions, the elements \nexist in their purest form: great expanses of solid earth, \nblazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. Any \nforeig-n substance is extremely rare; little air can be \nfound in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Earth, \nand earth is all but impossible to find in the outermost \nreaches of the Plane of Fire. These areas are much less \nhospitable to travelers from the Material Plane than \nthe border regions are. Such regions are little known, \nso when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a \nspeaker usually means the border region. \nThe outermost regions are largely the domains of \nelemental spirits barely recognizable as creatures. \nThe creatures usually called elementals dwell here, \nincluding the Elemental Princes of Evil (primordial \nbeings of pure elemental fury) and elemental spirits \nthat spellcasters can bind into galeb duhrs, golems, \ninvisible stalkers, magmin, and water weirds. These \nelemental creatures don\'t need food or other sustenance \non their home planes, because they are sustained by the \nelemental energies that saturate those planes. \nELEMENTAL CHAOS ----\nAt the farthest extents of the Elemental Planes, the pure \nelements dissolve and bleed together into an unending \n'},

Surviving vessels from countless worlds \nand navies ply these waters with little hope of ever \nreturning home. \nThe weather on the plane is a lesson in extremes. \nIf the sea isn't calm, it is battered by storms. On rare \noc.casions, a tremor in the planar firmament sends a \nrogue wave sweeping across the plane, swamping entire \nislands and driving ships down to the reefs. \nLife flourishes in the upper reaches of the Sea of \nWorlds, called the Sea of Light because of the sunlight \nfiltering down into the water. Aquatic humanoids craft \ncastles and fortresses in the coral reefs. The marids \nare the distant stewards of this region, content to allow \nthe lesser folk to compete for territory. The nominal \nemperor of the marids dwells in the Citadel ofTen \nThousand Pearls, an opulent palace made of coral and \nstudded with pearls. \nThe deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight \nreaches, are called the Darkened Depths.

As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine \nthe perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a border \nregion, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond \nordinary sensory experience. \nEven in perceptible regions, appearances can be \ndeceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear \nhospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. \nBut the landscape can change at a whim of the powerful \nforces that dwell on these planes, which can remake \nthem completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding \nexistence to better fulfill their divine needs. \nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the \nOuter Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes can \nseem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what \nseems like infinity. Adventurers could take a guided \ntour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, \nin a single day- if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it \ncould take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek \nacross a single layer. \nThe default Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes \nthat correspond to the eight alignments (excluding \nneutrality, which is represented by the Outlands, \ndescribed in the section on "Other Planes") and the \nshades of distinction between them. \nTHE OUTER PLANES \nOuter Plane \nMount Celestia, the Seven Heavens of \nBytopia, the Twin Paradises of \nElysium, the Blessed Fields of \nThe Beastlands, the Wilderness of \nArborea, the Olympian Glades of \nYsgard , the Heroic Domains of \nLimbo, the Ever-Changing Chaos of \nPandemonium, the Windswept Depths of \nThe Abyss, the Infinite Layers of \nCarceri, the Tarterian Depths of \nHades, the Gray Waste of \nGehenna, the Bleak Eternity of \nThe Nine Hells of Baator \nAcheron, the Infinite Battlefield of \nMechanus, the Clockwork Nirvana of \nArcadia, the Peaceable Kingdoms of \nAlignment \nLG \nNG, LG \nNG \nNG, CG \nCG \nCN,CG \nCN \nCN, CE \nCE \nNE,CE \nNE \nNE, LE \nLE \nLN , LE \nLN \nLN , LG \nThe planes with an element of good in their nature are \ncalled the Upper Planes, while those with an element \nof evil are the Lower Planes. A plane\'s alignment is \nits essence, and a character whose alignment doesn\'t \nmatch the plane\'s alignment experiences a sense of \ndissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, \nfor example, it feels in tune with the plane, but an \nevil creature feels out of tune and more than a little \nuncomfortable. \nThe Upper Planes are the home of celestial creatures, \nincluding angels, couatls, and pegasi. The Lower Planes \nare the home of fiends: demons, devils, yugoloths, \nand their ilk. The planes in between host their own \nunique denizens: the construct race of modrons \nCHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTT\\\'ERSE \ninhabit Mechanus, and the aberrations called slaadi \nthrive in Limbo. \nLAYERS OF THE O UTER PLANES \nMost of the Outer Planes include a number of distinct \nenvironments or realms. These realms are often \nimagined and depicted as a stack of related parts of the \nsame plane, so travelers refer to them as layers. For \nexample, Mount Celestia resembles a seven-tiered layer \ncake, the Nine Hells has nine layers, and the Abyss has \na seemingly endless number of layers. \nMost portals from elsewhere reach the first layer of a \nmultilayered plane. This layer is variously depicted as \nthe top or bottom layer, depending on the plane. As the \narrival point for most visitors, the first layer functions \nlike a city gate for that plane. \nTRAVELING THE OUTER PLANES \nTraveling between the Outer Planes isn\'t dissimilar \nfrom reaching the Outer Planes in the first place. \nCharacters traveling by means of the astral projection \nspell can go from one plane into the Astral Plane, and \nthere search out a color pool leading to the desired \ndestination. Characters can also use plane shift to reach \na different plane more directly. Most often, though, \ncharacters use portals- either a portal that links the two \nplanes directly or a portal leading to Sigil, City of Door . \nwhich holds portals to all the planes. \nTwo planar features connect multiple Outer Planes \ntogether: the River Styx and the Infinite Staircase. \nOther planar crossings might exist in your campaign, \nsuch as a World Tree whose roots touch the Lower \nPlanes and whose branches reach to the Upper Planes. \nor it might be possible to walk from one plane to another \nin your cosmology. \nTHE RIVER STYX \nThis river bubbles with grease, foul flotsam, and \nthe putrid remains of battles along its banks. Any \ncreature other than a fiend that tastes or touches the \nwater ·is affected by a feeblemind spell. The DC of the \nIntelligence saving throw to resist the effect is 15. \nThe Styx churns through the top layers of Acheron, \nthe Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and \nPandemonium. Tributaries of the Styx snake onto lower \nlayers of these planes. For example, a tendril of the Styx \nwinds through every layer of the Nine Hells, allowing \npassage from one layer of that plane to the next. \nSinister ferries float on the waters of the Styx, crewed \nby pilots skilled in negotiating the unpredictable \ncurrents and eddies of the river. For a price, these pilots \nare willing to carry passengers from plane to plane. \nSome of them are fiends, while others are the souls of \ndead creatures from the Material Plane. \nTHE INFINITE STAIRCASE \nThe Infinite Staircase is an extradimensional spiral \nstaircase that connects the planes. An entrance to the \nInfinite Staircase usually appears as a nondescript \ndoor. Beyond the portal lies a small landing with an \nequally nondescript stairway leading up and down.

A dispel evil and good spell \nremoves this effect from the creature. \nTHE BEASTLANDS \nThe Beastlands is a plane of nature unbound, of forests \nranging from moss-hung mangroves to snow-laden \npines, of thick jungles where the branches are woven so \ntight that no light penetrates, of vast plains where grains \nCHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE \nand wildflowers wave in the wind with vibrant life. The \nplane embodies nature's wildness and beauty, but it also \nspeaks to the animal within all living things. \nOPTIONAL RULE : HUNTER'S PARADISE \nVisitors to the Beastlands find their hunting and \nstalking capabilities improved, and characters have \nadvantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling), Wisdom \n(Perception), and Wisdom (Survival) checks while there. \nOPTIONAL RULE : BEAST TRANSFORMATION \nWhenever a visitor slays a beast native to the plane, the \nslayer must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw \nor become transformed (as the polymorph spell) into the \ntype of beast that was slain. In this form, the creature \nretains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of \neach long rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the \nsaving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature \nreturns to its true form. After three failed saving throws. \nthe transformation can be undone only by a remove \ncurse spell or similar magic. \nARBOREA \nLarger than life, Arborea is a place of violent moods \nand deep affections, of whim backed by steel, and of \npassions that blaze brightly until they burn out. Its \ngood-natured inhabitants are dedicated to fighting evil, \nbut their reckless emotions sometimes break free with \ndevastating consequences. Rage is as common and as \nhonored as joy in Arborea. There the mountains and \nforests are extravagantly massive and beautiful, and \nevery glade and stream is inhabited by nature spirits \nthat brook no infringement. Travelers must tread lightly. \nArborea is home to many elves and elven deities. Elve \nborn on this plane have the celestial type and are wild at \nheart, ready to battle evil in a heartbeat. Otherwise, they \nlook and behave like normal elves. \n"},

When the visitor leaves, it must make a \narisma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for \nach day spent on the plane.

At the end of each long \n~-r. the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending \ne effect on a success.

Fragments of more ordinary landscapes- bits \nof forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even burbling \nstreams-drift through the disorder. The whole plane is \na nightmarish riot. \nLimbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting the plane \nfloat in place. A creature can move up to its walking \nspeed in any direction by merely thinking of the desired \ndirection of travel. \nLimbo conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting \nit. Very disciplined and powerful minds can create \nwhole islands of their own invention within the plane, \nsometimes maintaining those places for years. A \nsimpleminded creature such as a fish, though, might \nhave less than a minute before the pocket of water \nsurrounding it freezes, vanishes, or turns to glass. \nThe slaadi live here and swim amid this chaos, \ncreating nothing, whereas githzerai monks build entire \nmonasteries with their minds. \nOPTIONAL RULE: POWER OF THE MIND \nAs an action, a creature on Limbo can make an \nIntelligence check to mentally move an object on \nthe plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC \ndepends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for \nSmall, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 \nfor Huge or larger.

The same rules for distance \napply, and the DC is based on the object's size: DC \n10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and \nDC 25 for Large or larger.

  'text': 'Finally, a creature can use an action to make an \nIntelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered \non the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the \nsphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; \neach additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the \nDC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents \nthe area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or \nuntil the creature uses this ability again. \nPANDEMONIUM \nPandemonium is a plane of madness, a great mass of \nrock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is \ncold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly \nextinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches \nand campfires. It also makes conversation possible only \nby yelling, and even then only to a maximum distance \nof 10 feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability \ncheck that relies on hearing. \nMost of the plane\'s inhabitants are creatures that were \nbanished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many \nof them have been driven mad by the incessant winds \nor forced to take shelter in places where the winds die \ndown until they sound like distant cries of torment. \nOPTIONAL RULE: MAD WINDS \nA visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw \nafter each hour spent among the howling winds. On a \nfailed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. \nA creature that reaches six levels of exhaustion while \non this plane doesn\'t die. Instead, the creature gains \na random form of indefinite madness, as described in \nchapter 8, "Running the Game." Finishing a long rest \ndoesn\'t reduce a creature\'s exhaustion level unless the \ncreature can somehow escape the maddening winds. \nTHE ABYSS \n----------- --\nThe Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and \nchaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into \never more appalling forms. \nEach layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific \nenvironment. Although no two layers are alike, they are \nall harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the \nen tropic nature of the Abyss. In fact, much of what one \nsees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, \ncrumbling, or corroded state. \nOPTIONAL RULE: ABYSSAL CORRUPTION \nA non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss \nmust make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a \nfailure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the \nAbyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of \nthis corruption. You can substitute different corruption \neffects of your own creation. \nAfter finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can \nmake a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful \nsave, the corruption effect ends. A dispel evil and good \nspell or any magic that removes a curse also ends \nthe effect. \nIf a corrupted creature doesn\'t leave the plane within \nld4 + 2 days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil. \nCasting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature \nrestores its original alignment. \nCHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE \nABYSSAL CoRRUPTION \ndlO \nResult \n1-4 \nTreachery. The character gains the following flaw: \n5-7 \n8-9 \n10 \n"I can only achieve my goals by making sure that \nmy companions don\'t achieve theirs." \nBloodlust. The character gains the following flaw: \n"I enjoy killing for its own sake, and once I start, \nit\'s hard to stop." \nMad Ambition. The character gains the following \nflaw: "I am destined to rule the Abyss, and my \ncompanions are tools to that end." \nDemonic Possession. The character is possessed \nby a demonic entity until freed by dispel evil and \ngood or similar magic. Whenever the possessed \ncharacter rolls a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, \nor saving throw, the demon takes control of the \ncharacter and determines the character\'s behavior. \nAt the end of each of the possessed character\'s \nturns, he or she can make a DC 15 Charisma saving \nthrow. On a success, the character regains control \nuntil he or she rolls another 1. \nIMPORTANT LAYERS \nThe layers of the Abyss are defined by the demon lords \nwho rule them, as the following examples illustrate. \nMore information about the demon lords can be found in \nthe Monster Manual. \nThe Gaping Maw. Demogorgon\'s layer in the Abyss \nis a vast wilderness of savagery and madness known \nas the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons \ngo insane with fear. Reflecting Demogorgon\'s dual \nnature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval \ncontinent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a \nseemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine fiats. The \nPrince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine \ntowers, which emerge from a turbid sea. Each tower \nis topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires \nconstitute the fortress of Abysm, where few creatures \ncan venture without descending into madness. \nThanatos. If Orcus had his way, all planes would \nresemble his dead realm of Thanatos, and all creatures \nwould become undead under his control. Under its \nblack sky, Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren \nmoors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. \nTombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi \nlitter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, \nbursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any \ncreatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules \nThanatos from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted \nof obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland \ncalled Oblivion\'s End, the palace is surrounded by tombs \nand burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow \nvalleys, creating a tiered necropolis. \nThe Demonweb. Lolth\'s layer is an immense network \nof thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and \ncocoon-like chambers. Throughout the web, buildings, \nstructures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught \nin a spider\'s snare. The nature of Lolth\'s web creates \nrandom portals throughout the plane, drawing such \nobjects in from demiplanes and Material Plane worlds \n'},

  'text': 'that figure into the schemes of the Spider Queen. \nLolth\'s servants also build dungeons amid the webbing, \ntrapping and hunting Lolth\'s hated enemies within \ncrisscrossing corridors of web-mortared stone. \nFar beneath these dungeons lie the bottomless \nDemonweb Pits where the Spider Queen dwells. There, \nLolth is surrounded by her handmaidens- yochlol \ndemons created to serve her and which outrank \nmightier demons while in the Spider Queen\'s realm. \nThe Endless Maze. Baphomet\'s layer of the Abyss is \na never-ending dungeon, the center of which holds the \nHorned King\'s enormous ziggurat palace. A confusing \njumble of crooked hallways and myriad chambers, the \npalace is surrounded by a mile-wide moat concealing \na maddening series of submerged stairs and tunnels \neading deeper into the fortress. \nThe Triple Realm. The Dark Prince Graz\'zt rules \nover the realm of Azzagrat, which encompasses three \nayers of the Abyss. His seat of power is the fantastic \nArgent Palace in the city of Zelatar, whose bustling \nmarkets and pleasure palaces draw visitors from across \nme multiverse in search of obscure magical lore and \nperverse delights. By Graz\'zt\'s command, the demons \nof Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly \ncomity. However, the so-called Triple Realm holds as \nuch danger as any other part of the Abyss, and planar \ni itors can vanish without a trace in its mazelike cities \nand in forests whose trees have serpents for branches. \nDeath DeJJs. Yeenoghu rules a layer of ravines known \nDeath Dells. Here, creatures must hunt to survive. \n.=:ven the plants, which must bathe their roots in blood, \n- are the unwary. Yeenoghu\'s servants, helping to sate \neir master\'s hunger as he prowls his kingdom seeking \n_ ey, capture creatures from the Material Plane for \nlease in the Gnoll Lord\'s realm. \nCARCERI \n-:-he model for all other prisons in existence, Carceri \n- a plane of desolation and despair. Its six layers hold \nr bogs, fetid jungles, windswept deserts, jagged \nountains, frigid oceans, and black ice. All form a \n· erable home for the traitors and backstabbers that \n--e trapped on this prison plane. \nO PTIONAL RULE: PRISON PLA NE \n_ -o one can leave Carceri easily. Magical efforts to leave \n· e plane by any spell other than a wish simply fail. \n:&gt;onals and gates that open onto the plane become one-\ny only. Secret ways out of the plane exist, but they are \n- -dden and well guarded by traps and deadly monsters. \n:-lADES \n-----------------------------------\n-\ne layers of Hades are called the Three Glooms-\naces without joy, hope, or passion. A gray land with \n:~ ashen sky, Hades is the destination of many souls \n- ar are unclaimed by the gods of the Upper Planes or \n· e fiendish rulers of the Lower Planes. These souls \n- come larvae and spend eternity in this place that \ncks a sun, a moon, stars, or seasons. Leaching away \nlor and emotion, this gloom is more than most visitors \ncan stand. The "Shadowfell Despair" rule earlier in the \napter can be used to represent a visitor\'s despair. \nOPTIONAL RULE : V I LE TRA NSFORMATION \nAt the end of each long rest taken on the plane, a visitor \nmust make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed \nsave, the creature gains one level of exhaustion, which \ncan\'t be removed while the creature remains in Hades. \nIf the creature reaches six levels of exhaustion, it doesn\'t \ndie. Instead, the creature permanently transforms into \na larva, whereupon all levels of exhaustion afflicting the \ncreature are removed. \nA larva is a miserable fiend that retains the facial \nfeatures of its previous form but has the body of a fat \nworm. A larva has only a few faint memories of its \nprevious life and the statistics in the larva stat block. \nHades is crawling with larvae. Night hags, liches, and \nrakshasas harvest them for use in vile rituals. Other \nfiends like to feed on them. \nLARVA \nMedium fiend, neutral evil \nArmor Class 9 \nHit Points 9 (2d8) \nSpeed 20ft. \nSTR \n9 (-1) \nDEX \n9 (-1) \nCON \n10 (+0) \nSenses passive Perception 10 \nINT \n6 (- 2) \nWIS \n10 (+0) \nCHA \n2 (-4) \nLanguages understands the languages it knew in life but \ncan\'t speak \nChallenge 0 (10 XP) \nACTIONS \nBite. Melee Weapon Attack:+ 1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. \nHit: 1 (1d4- 1) piercing damage. \nGEHENNA \nGehenna is the plane of suspicion and greed. It is the \nbirthplace of the yugoloths, which dwell here in great \nnumbers. A volcanic mountain dominates each of the \nfour layers of Gehenna, and lesser volcanic earth bergs \ndrift in the air and smash into the greater mountains. \nThe rocky slopes of the plane make movement here \ndifficult and dangerous. The ground inclines at least \n45 degrees almost everywhere. In places, steep cliffs \nand deep canyons present more challenging obstacles. \nHazards include volcanic fissures that vent noxious \nfumes or searing flames. \nGehenna has no room for mercy or compassion. The \nfiends living here are among the greediest and most \nselfish in all the multiverse. \nOPTIONAL RULE: CRUEL HINDRANCE \nThe plane\'s cruel nature makes it difficult for visitors to \nhelp one another. Whenever a visitor casts a spell with a \nbeneficial effect, including a spell that restores hit points \nor removes a condition, the caster must first make a DC \n10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell \nfails, the spell slot is expended, and the action is wasted. \nCHAPTER 2 I CREATTNG A MULTI VERSE \n'},

  'text': "THE NINE HELLS \nThe Nine Hells of Baa tor inflame the imaginations of \ntravelers, the greed of treasure seekers, and the battle \nfury of all moral creatures. It is the ultimate plane of \nlaw and evil and the epitome of premeditated cruelty. \nThe devils of the Nine Hells are bound to obey the laws \nof their superiors, but they rebel within their individual \ncastes. Most undertake any plot, no matter how foul, \nto advance themselves. At the very top of the hierarchy \nis Asmodeus, who has yet to be bested. If he were to \nbe vanquished, the victor would rule the plane in turn. \nSuch is the law of the Nine Hells. \nOPTIONAL RULE: PERVASIVE EVIL \nEvil pervades the Nine Hells, and visitors to this plane \nfeel its influence. At the end of each long rest taken on \nthis plane, a visitor that isn't evil must make a DC 10 \nWisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's \nalignment changes to lawful evil. The change becomes \npermanent if the creature doesn't leave the plane within \nld4 days. Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts \nto normal after one day spent on a plane other than the \nNine Hells. Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the \ncreature also restores its original alignment. \nTHE NINE LAYERS \nThe Nine Hells has nine layers. The first eight are \neach ruled by archdevils that answer to Asmodeus, \nthe Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the \ndeepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend \nthrough all eight of the layers above it, in order. The \nmost expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, \nwhich plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer \nto the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can \nwithstand the torment and horror of that journey. \nAvernus. No planar portals connect directly to the \nlower layers of the Nine Hells, by Asmodeus's orders. \nAs such, the first layer of Avernus is the arrival point \nfor visitors to the plane. A vern us is a rocky wasteland \nwith rivers of blood and clouds of biting flies. Fiery \ncomets occasionally fall from the darkened sky and \nleave fuming impact craters behind. Empty battlefields \nare littered with weapons and bones, showing where the \nlegions of the Nine Hells met enemies on their native \nsoil and prevailed. \nThe archduchess Zariel rules Avernus, supplanting \nher rival, Bel, who has fallen out of Asmodeus's favor \nand is forced to serve as Zariel's advisor. Tiamat, the \nQueen of Evil Dragons, is a prisoner on this layer, \nruling her own domain but confined to the Nine Hells \nby Asmodeus in accordance with some ancient contract \n(the terms of which are known only to Tiamat and the \nLords of the Nine). \nZariel's seat of power is a soaring basalt citadel \nfestooned with the partially incinerated corpses of \nguests who failed to earn the archduchess's favor. Zariel \nappears as an angel whose once-beautiful skin and \nwings have been ruined by fire. Her eyes burn with a \nfurious white light that can cause creatures looking \nupon her to burst into flame. \nDis. Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells, is a \nlabyrinth of canyons wedged between sheer mountains \nCHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE \nrich with iron ore. Iron roads span and wend through \nthe canyons, watched over by the garrisons of iron \nfortresses perched atop jagged pinnacles. \nThe second layer takes its name from its current lord. \nDispater. A manipulator and deceiver, the archduke is \ndevilishly handsome, bearing only small horns, a tail, \nand a cloven left hoof to distinguish him from a human. \nHis crimson throne stands in the heart of the Iron City \nof Dis, a hideous metropolis that is the largest in the \nNine Hells. Planar travelers come here to conspire with \ndevils and to close deals with night hags, rakshasas, \nincubi, succubi, and other fiends. Dispater collects a \npiece of every deal through special provisions that are \nadded to contracts signed on his layer of the Nine Hells. \nDispater is one of Asmodeus's most loyal and \nresourceful vassals, and few beings in the multiverse \ncan outwit him. He is more obsessed than most devils \nwith striking deals with mortals in exchange for their \nsouls, and his emissaries work tirelessly to foster evil \nschemes in the Material Plane. \nMinauros. The third layer of the Nine Hells is a \nstench-ridden bog. Acidic rain spills from the layer's \nbrown skies, thick layers of scum cover its putrid \nsurface, and yawning pits lie in wait beneath the murk to \nengulf careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of ornately \ncarved stone rise up from the bog, including the great \ncity of Minauros for which the layer is named. \nThe slimy walls of the city rise hundreds of feet into \nthe air, protecting the flooded halls of Mammon. The \nArchduke of Minauros resembles a massive serpent \nwith the upper torso and head of a hairless, horned \nhumanoid. Mammon's greed is legendary, and he is \none of the few arch devils who will trade favors for gold \ninstead of souls. His lair is piled high with treasures \nleft behind by those who tried-and failed-to best him \nin a deal. \nPhlegethos. Phlegethos, the fourth layer, is a \nfiery landscape whose seas of molten magma brew \nhurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke, and pyroclastic \nash. Within the fire-filled caldera of Phlegethos's largest \nvolcano rises Abriymoch, a fortress city cast of obsidian \nand dark glass. With rivers of molten lava pouring \ndown its outer walls, the city resembles the sculpted \ncenterpiece of a gigantic, hellish fountain. \nAbriymoch is the seat of power for the two archdevils \nwho rule Phlegethos in tandem: Archduke Belial and \nArchduchess Fierna, Belial's daughter. Belial is a \nhandsome, powerfully built devil who exudes civility, \neven as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His \ndaughter is a statuesque devil whose beauty encases the \nblackest heart in the \nine Hells. The alliance of Belial \nand Fierna is unbreakable, for both are aware that their \nmutual survival hinges on it. \nStygia. The fifth layer of the Nine Hells is a freezing \nrealm of ice within which cold flames burn. A frozen sea \nsurrounds the layer. and its gloomy sky crackles with \nlightning. \nArchduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and is \nnow encased deep in the ice of Stygia as punishment. \nHe rules this layer all the same, communicating \ntelepathically with hi followers and servants, both in \nthe Nine Hells and on the Material Plane. \n"},

  'text': "Stygia is also home to its previous ruler, the \nserpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed \nby Asmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus \nto regain his rule. Geryon's fall from grace has \nspurred much debate within the infernal courts. No \none is certain whether Asmodeus had some secret \ncause to dismiss the archdevil or whether he is testing \nGeryon's allegiance for some greater purpose. \nMalbolge. Malbolge, the sixth layer, has outlasted \nmany rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess \nand the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell out of favor and \nwas struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while \nher predecessor, Moloch, still lingers somewhere on \nthe sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus's \nfavor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the \nsides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the \nlayer break off from time to time, creating deadly and \ndeafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants of \n.Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves \ncarved into the mountainside. \nMalbolge's current archduchess is Asmodeus's \ndaughter, Glasya. She resembles a succubus with \nher small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She \ninherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from \nher father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on \nthe slopes of Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars \nand buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on the verge of \ncollapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with \ncells and torture chambers, where Glasya confines and \ntorments those who displease her. \nMaladomini. The seventh layer, Maladomini, is ruin-\ncovered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban \nlandscape, and between them lie empty quarries, \ncrumbling roads, slag heaps, the hollow shells of \nempty fortresses, and swarms of hungry flies. \nThe Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul, \nthe Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend with the lower \nbody of an enormous slug, Baalzebul's form was \ninflicted on him by Asmodeus as punishment for \nwavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a miserable and \ndegenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to \nusurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries \na curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to \ncalamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows Baalzebul favor \nfor reasons no other archduke can fathom, though some \nsuspect that the Archduke of Ness us still respects the \nworthiness of this fallen adversary. \nCania. Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells, is \nan icy hellscape, whose ice storms can tear flesh from \nbone. Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for \nguests and prisoners of Cania's ruler, the brilliant and \nconniving archdevil Mephistopheles. \nMephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar, \nwhere he plots to seize the Throne of Baator and \nconquer the planes. He is Asmodeus's greatest enemy \nand ally, and the Archduke of Ness us appears to \ntrust Mephistopheles's counsel when it is offered. \nMephistopheles knows he can't depose Asmodeus until \nhis adversary makes a grave miscalculation, and so \nboth wait to see what circumstances might turn them \n"},

Mephistopheles is also a godfather of \nsorts to Glasya, further complicating the relationship. \nMephistopheles is a tall, striking devil with impressive \nhorns and a cool demeanor. He trades in souls, asv o \nother archdevils, but he rarely gives his time to any \ncreatures not worthy of his person~! ~ttention .. His \ninstincts are as razor sharp as Camas fngtd wmds, \nand it is said that only Asmodeus has ever d~vea or \nthwarted him. \n/ \nNessus. The lowest layer of the Nine"\'Hells, Ness us is \na realm of dark pits whose walls are set with fortresses. \nThere, pit fiend generals loyal to Asmodeus garrison \ntheir diabolical legions and p)ot the conquest of the \nmultiverse. At the center oUhe layer stands a vast \nrift of unknown depth, out of which rises the great \ncitadel-spire of Malsheem, home to Asmodeus and his \ninfernal court. \nMalsheem resembles a gigantic hollowed-out \nstalagmite. The citadel is also a prison for souls that \nAsmodeus has locked away for safekeeping. Convincing \nhim to release even one of those souls comes at a steep \nprice, and it is rumored that the Archduke of Nessus has \nclaimed whole kingdoms in the past for such favors. \nAsmodeus most often appears as a handsome, \nbearded humanoid with small horns protruding from \nhis forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing robes. \nHe can also assume other forms and is seldom seen \nwithout his ruby-tipped scepter in hand. Asmodeus is \nthe most cunning and well-mannered of archdevils. The \nultimate evil he represents can be seen only when he \nwills it so, or if he forgets himself and flies into a rage. \nACHERON \nAcheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron \ncubes floating in an airy void. Sometimes the cubes \ncollide. Echoes of past collisions linger throughout the \nplane, mingling with the sounds of armies colliding. \nThat\'s the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the \nspirits of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against \norcs devoted to Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet, \nand legions assembled by other warmongering gods. \nOPTIONAL RULE: BLOODLUST \nAcheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures \nby imbuing that creature with the strength to keep \nfighting.

Mechanus \nembodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt on \nthose who spend time here. \nModrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus. \nThe plane is also home to the creator of the modrons: a \ngodlike being called Primus. \nOPTIONAL RULE: LAW OF AVERAGES \nWhile on Mechanus, creatures always use the average \ndamage result for attacks and spells. For example, an \nattack that normally deals ldlO + 5 damage always \ndeals 10 damage on Mechanus. \nOPTIONAL RULE: IMPOSING ORDER \nAt the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor \nthat isn\'t lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom \nsaving throw. On a failed save, the creature\'s alignment \nchanges to lawful neutral. The creature\'s alignment \nreverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other \nthan Mechanus. Casting the dispel evil and good spell \non the creature also restores its original alignment. \nARCADI~A~---------------------\xad\nArcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees, \nruler-straight streams, orderly fields, perfect roads, and \ncities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The \nmountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on \nArcadia works toward the common good and a flawless \nform of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing \nintrudes on harmony. \nNight and day are determined by an orb that floats \nabove Arcadia\'s highest peak. Half of the orb radiates \nsunlight and brings about the day; the other half sheds \nmoonlight and brings on the starry night. The orb \nrotates evenly without fail, spreading day and night \nacross the entire plane. \nThe weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied \ndemigods called the Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the \nWind Queen, the Lightning King, and the Rain Queen. \nEach one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of \nweather that king or queen controls. \nHidden below Arcadia\'s beautiful mountains are \nnumerous dwarven kingdoms that have withstood \nthe passage of millennia.

Planar emissaries often meet in \nthese towns, so it isn't unusual to see strange pairings, \nsuch as a celestial and a fiend arguing in a tavern while \nsharing a fine bottle of wine. \nGiven the fact that you can ride a horse in the \nOutlands from a heaven to a hell, a planar-themed \ncampaign can be set there without the need for planar \ntravel.

  'text': "68 \nSIGIL, CITY OF DOORS \nAt the center of the Outlands, like the axle of a great \nwheel, is the Spire-a needle-shaped mountain that \nrises high into the sky. Above this mountain's narrow \npeak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, its myriad \nstructures built on the ring's inner rim. Creatures \nstanding on one of Sigil's streets can see the city curve \nup over their heads and- most disconcerting of all-the \nfar side of the city directly overhead. Called the City of \nDoors, this bustling planar metropolis holds countless \nportals to other planes and worlds. \nSigil is a trader's paradise. Goods, merchandise, and \ninformation come here from across the planes. The city \nsustains a brisk trade in information about the planes, \nparticularly the command words or items required for \nthe operation of particular portals. Portal keys of all \nkinds are bought and sold here. \nThe city is the domain of the inscrutable Lady of Pain, \na being as old as gods and with purposes unknown to \neven the sages of her city. Is Sigil her prison? Is she the \nfallen creator of the multiverse? No one knows. Or if \nthey do, they aren't telling. \nDEMIPLANES \nDemiplanes are extradimensional spaces that come \ninto being by a variety of means and boast their own \nphysical laws. Some are created by spells. Others exist \nnaturally, as folds of reality pinched off from the rest \nof the multiverse. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can \ncarry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency \nrequired for the tuning fork would be extremely hard to \nacquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the \ncaster knows of the demiplane. \nA demiplane can be as small as a single chamber or \nlarge enough to contain an entire realm. For example, \na Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion spell creates a \ndemiplane consisting of a foyer with multiple adjoining \nrooms, while the land of Barovia (in the Ravenloft \nsetting) exists entirely within a demiplane under the \nsway of its vampire lord, Strahd von Zarovich. When a \ndemiplane is connected to the Material Plane or some \nother plane, entering it can be as simple as stepping \nthrough a portal or passing through a wall of mist. \nTHE FAR REALM \nThe Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In \nfact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its \nown physical and magical laws. Where stray energies \nfrom the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter \nis warped into alien shapes that defy understandable \ngeometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers \nand beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its \nstrange influence. \nThe entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are \ntoo alien for a normal mind to accept without strain. \nTitanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and \nunspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who \ndare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm \nis a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of \nmatter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this \nstruggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone \nCHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE \nI \nwho has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes, \ntentacles. and horror. \nThe Far Realm has no well-know;n portals, or at least \nnone that are still viable. Ancient elves once opened a \nvast portal to the Far Realm within ~ mountain called \nFirestorm Peak, but their civilizatioi imploded in bloody \nterror and the portal's location-eve \n1 its home world- is \nlong forgotten. Lost portals might still exist, marked by \nan alien magic that mutates the area kround them. \nKNOWN WORLDS dF \nTHE \nI \nMATERIAL PLANE \nWorlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse. The \nmost widely known worlds are the ones that have been \npublished as official campaign settings for the D&amp;D \ngame over the years. If your campaign takes place on \none of these worlds, that world belongs to you in your \ncampaign. Your version of the world can diverge wildly \nfrom what's in print. \nOn Toril (the heroic-fantasy world of the Forgotten \nRealms setting), fantastic cities and kingdoms stand \namid the remains of ancient empires and realms \nlong forgotten. The world is vast, its dungeons rich \nwith history. Beyond the central continent of Faerun, \nTori! includes the regions of Al-Qadim, Kara-Tur, \nand Maztica. \nOn Oerth (the sword-and-sorcery world of the \nGreyhawk setting), heroes such as Bigby and \nMordenkainen are driven by greed or ambition. The \nhub of the region called the Flanaess is the Free City of \nGreyhawk, a city of scoundrels and arch magi, rife with \nadventure. An evil demigod, Iuz, rules a nightmarish \nrealm in the north, threatening all civilization. \nOn Krynn (the epic-fantasy world of the Dragonlance \nsetting),. the return of the gods is overshadowed by the \nrise of the evil dragon queen Takhisis and her dragons \nand dragonarmies, which plunge the continent of \nAnsalon into war. \nOn Athas (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Dark \nSun setting), a drop of water can be worth more than a \nhuman life. The gods have abandoned this desert world, \nwhere powerful sorcerer-kings rule as tyrants, and \nmetal is a scarce and precious commodity. \nOn Eberron (the heroic-fantasy world of the Eberron \nsetting), a terrible war has ended, giving rise to a cold \nwar fueled by political intrigue. On the continent of \nKhorvaire, magic is commonplace, dragonmarked \nhouses rival kingdoms in power, and elemental vehicles \nmake travel to the far corners of the world possible. \nOn Aebrynis (the heroic-fantasy world of the \nBirthright setting), scions born from divine bloodlines \ncarve up the continent of Cerilia. Monarchs, prelates, \nguildmasters, and great wizards balance the demands \nof rulership against the threat of horrible abominations \nborn from the blood of an evil god. \nOn Mystara (a heroic-fantasy world born out of the \nearliest editions of the D&amp;D game), diverse cultures, \nsavage monsters, and warring empires collide. \nThe world is further shaped by the meddling of the \nImmortals- former adventurers raised to nearly \ndivine status. \n"},

  'text': 'CHAPTER 3: CREATING A DV ENTURES \n~ \nREATI G ADVENTURES IS ONE OF THE GREATEST \nrewards of being a Dungeon Master. It\'s a \nway to express yourself, designing fantastic \nlocations and encounters with monsters, \ntraps, puzzles, and conflicts. When you \ndesign an adventure, you call the shots. You \no things exactly the way you want to. \nFundamentally, adventures are stories. An adventure \nshares many of the features of a novel, a movie, an \n:ssue of a comic, or an episode of a TV show. Comic \nseries and serialized TV dramas are particularly good \ncomparisons, because of the way individual adventures \nare limited in scope but blend together to create a larger \nnarrative. If an adventure is a single issue or episode, a \ncampaign is the series as a whole. \nWhether you\'re creating your own adventures or using \n;JUblished adventures, you\'ll find advice in this chapter \n~o help you create a fun and memorable experience for \n:.·our players. \nCreating an adventure involves blending scenes of \nexploration, social interaction, and combat into a unified \nwhole that meets the needs of your players and your \ncampaign. But it\'s more than that. The basic elements \nof good storytelling should guide you throughout this \n;Jrocess, so your players experience the adventure as a \n- ory and not a disjointed series of encounters. \nELEMENTS OF A \nGREAT ADVENTURE \n-=-he best adventures have several things in common. \n_-\\_ C REDIBLE THREAT \n_-\\n adventure needs a threat worthy of the heroes\' \nc. rention. The threat might be a single villain or \n;:nonster, a villain with lackeys, an assortment of \n::::wnsters, or an evil organization. Whatever their \narure, the antagonists should have goals that the \n:-:eroes can uncover and thwart. \n?.-\\MILlAR TROPES WITH CLEVER TWISTS \n:-might seem stereotypical to build an adventure \n;;sound dragons, orcs, and insane wizards in towers, \n"Jut these are staples of fantasy storytelling. It might \nalso seem trite to begin an adventure in a tavern, but \n~h at\'s an idea that remains true to D&amp;D. Familiar \nsrory elements are fine, as long as you and the players \noccasionally put a spin on them. For example, the \n:-nysterious figure who presents adventurers with \na quest on behalf of the king might be the king in \nd.isguise. The crazy wizard in the tower might be a \n;Jrojected illusion created by a band of greedy gnome \ndlieves to guard their loot. \n_\\ C LEAR Focus oN THE PRESENT \n.-ill adventure is about the here and now. A little bit \nof history might be needed to set the story in motion, \nand the adventurers might discover interesting lore of \n:.1e past in the course of the adventure. In general, let \nrhe world\'s history be evident in the present situation. \nInstead of dealing with what happened in the past, \nan adventure should focus on describing the present \nsituation, what the bad guys are up to, and how the \nadventurers become involved in the story. \nHEROES WHO MATTER \nAn adventure should allow the adventurers\' actions and \ndecisions to matter. Though it might resemble a novel \nor a TV episode, an adventure needs to allow for more \nthan one outcome. Otherwise, players can feel as if \nthey\'ve been railroaded- set onto a course that has only \none destination, no matter how hard they try to change \nit. For example, if a major villain shows up before the \nend of the adventure, the adventure should allow for the \npossibility that the heroes might defeat that villain. \nSoMETHING FOR ALL PLAYER TYPES \nAs outlined in the book\'s introduction, players come \nto the gaming table with different expectations. An \nadventure needs to account for the different players and \ncharacters in your group, drawing them into the story as \neffectively as possible. \nAs a starting point, think about your adventure in \nterms of the three basic types of activity in the game: \nexploration, social interaction, and combat. If your \nadventure includes a balance of all three, it\'s likely to \nappeal to all types of players. \nAn adventure you create for your home campaign \ndoesn\'t have to appeal to every abstract player type-\nonly to the players sitting down at your own table. If you \ndon\'t have any players who like fighting above all else, \nthen don\'t feel you have to provide a maximum amount \nof combat to keep the adventure moving. \nSURPRISES \nLook for opportunities to surprise and delight your \nplayers. For example, the exploration of a ruined castle \non a hill might lead to the discovery of a dragon\'s tomb \nhidden underneath. A trek through the wilderness \nmight lead to the discovery of a tower that appears only \non nights of the full moon. Players remember such \nlocations. \nToo many surprises can be off-putting to players, but \nadding the occasional twist gets players to adjust their \ntactics and think creatively. For example, you could \nspruce up a goblin lair by including goblin sappers \nwith kegs of oil strapped to their backs. An attack on a \nvillain\'s estate might be complicated by the unexpected \narrival of a special guest. \nWhen preparing for possible combat encounters, \nthink about odd pairings of monsters, such as a \nhobgoblin warlord and his pet manticore, or will-\no\'-wisps in league with a young black dragon. Have \nsurprise reinforcements show up, or give the monsters \nunusual tactics. Throw in the occasional red herring, \ndeception, and plot twist to keep players on their toes, \nbut try not to go overboard. Sometimes a simple, \nstraightforward encounter with an ore guard is just as \nfun for your players. \nCHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES \n'},

  'text': "USEFUL MAPS \nA good adventure needs thoughtfully constructed \nmaps. Wilderness areas sprinkled with interesting \nlandmarks and other features are better than vast \nexpanses of unchanging terrain. Dungeons that have \nbranching corridors and similar decision points give \nplayers the opportunity to choose which direction their \ncharacters should go. Presenting the characters with \noptions allows the players to make choices that keep the \nadventure unpredictable. \nIf drawing maps isn't your strong suit, the Internet is \na great place to look for adventure maps that have been \nmade freely available for use, as well as floor plans of \nreal-world buildings and images that can inspire your \nmapmaking. You can also use software to help put your \nmaps together. \nPUBLISHED ADVENTURES \nPublished adventures are available for purchase if you \nhave neither the time nor the inclination to write an \nadventure of your own, or if you want a change of pace. \nA published adventure includes a pregenerated scenario \nwith the maps, NPCs, monsters, and treasures you need \nto run it. An example of a published adventure appears \nin the D&amp;D Starter Set. \nYou can make adjustments to a published adventure \nso that it better suits your campaign and appeals to \nyour players. For example, you can replace the villain \nof an adventure with one the players have already \nencountered in your campaign, or add something to \nthe background of the adventure so that it involves your \nplayers' characters in ways that the adventure's designer \nnever could have imagined. \nA published adventure can't account for every \naction the characters might take. The nice thing \nabout published adventures is that they allow you to \nfocus your game preparation time on highlighting plot \ndevelopments in your campaign that the adventure \ncan't address. \nPublished adventures also provide inspiration. You \nmight not use an adventure as written, but it might spur \nideas, or you can pull out one part of it and repurpose \nthat part for your needs. For example, you might use a \nmap of a temple but repopulate it with monsters of your \nchoice, or you might use a chase sequence as a model \nfor a pursuit scene in your campaign. \nADVENTURE STRUCTURE \nLike every story, a typical adventure has a beginning, a \nmiddle, and an end. \nBEGINNING \nAn adventure starts with a hook to get the players \ninterested. A good adventure hook piques the interest \nof the players and provides a compelling reason for \ntheir characters to become involved in the adventure. \nMaybe the adventurers stumble onto something they're \nnot meant to see, monsters attack them on the road, an \nassassin makes an attempt on their lives, or a dragon \nshows up at the city gates. Adventure hooks such as \nthese can instantly draw players into your story. \nCHAPTER 3 I CREATJNG ADVENTURES \nThe beginning of a good adventure should be exciting \nand focused. You want the players to go home looking \nforward to the next session, so give them a clear sense \nof where the story is headed, as well as something to \nlook forward to. \nMIDDLE \nThe middle of an adventure is where the bulk of the \nstory unfolds. With each new challenge, the adventurers \nmake important choices that have a clear effect on the \nconclusion of the adventure. \nOver the course of the adventure, the characters might \ndiscover secrets that reveal new goals or change their \noriginal goal. Their understanding of what's going on \naround them might change. Maybe rumors of treasure \nwere a trick to lure them into a death trap. Perhaps \nthe so-called spy in the queen's court is actually a \nscheme concocted by the monarch herself to seize even \nmore power. \nAt the same time the adventurers are working to \nthwart their adversaries, those adversaries are trying \nto carry out their nefarious plans. Such enemies \nmight also work to hide their deeds, mislead potential \nadversaries, or confront problems directly, perhaps by \ntrying to kill meddlers. \nRemember that the characters are the heroes of the \nstory. Never let them become mere spectators, watching \nas events unfold around them that they can't influence. \nENDING \nThe ending encompasses the climax- the scene or \nencounter in which the tension building throughout the \nadventure reaches its peak. A strong climax should have \nthe players on edge, with the fate of the characters and \nmuch more hanging in the balance. The outcome, which \nhinges on the characters' actions and decisions, should \nnever be a forgone conclusion. \nAn ending needn't tie everything up in a neat bow. \nStory threads can be left hanging, waiting to be resolved \nin a later adventure. A little bit of unfinished business is \nan easy way to transition from one adventure to the next. \nADVENTURE TYPES \nAn adventure can be location-based or event-based, as \ndiscussed in the sections that follow. \nLOCATION-BASED ADVENTURES \nAdventures set in crumbling dungeons and remote \nwilderness locations are the cornerstone of countless \ncampaigns. Many of the greatest D&amp;D adventures of all \ntime are location-based. \nCreating a location-based adventure can be broken \ndown into a number of steps. Each step provides tables \nfrom which you can select the basic elements of your \nadventure. Alternatively, roll on the tables and see how \nthe random results inspire you. You can mix up the \norder of the steps. \n1. IDENTIFY THE PARTY'S GOALS \nThe Dungeon Goals table provides common goals \nthat drive or lure adventurers into dungeons. The \n"},

Although the climax must hinge \n:;:: rhe successes and failures of the characters up to \n·.::a moment, the Adventure Climax table can provide \n~::ggestions to help you shape the end of your adventure. \nDVENTURE CLIMAX \ndl2 \nClimax \nThe a"dventurers confront the main villain and a \ngroup of minions in a bloody battle to the finish. \n2 \nThe adventurers chase the villain while dodging \nobstacles designed to thwart them, leading to a final \nconfrontation in or outside the villain\'s refuge. \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \nThe actions of the adventurers or the villain result \nin a cataclysmic event that the adventurers must \nescape. \nThe adventurers race to the site where the villain is \nbringing a master plan to its conclusion, arriving \njust as that plan is about to be completed. \nThe villain and two or three lieutenants perform \nseparate rites in a large room. The adventurers \nmust disrupt all the rites at the same time. \nAn ally betrays the adventurers as they\'re about to \nachieve their goal. (Use this climax carefully, and \ndon\'t overuse it.) \nA portal opens to another plane of existence. \nCreatures on the other side spill out, forcing the \nadventurers to close the portal and deal with the \nvillain at the same time. \nTraps, hazards, or animated objects turn against \nthe adventurers while the main villain attacks. \nThe dungeon begins to collapse while the \nadventurers face the main villain, who attempts to \nescape in the chaos. \nA threat more powerful than the adventurers \nappears, destroys the main villain, and then turns \nits attention on the characters. \nThe adventurers must choose whether to pursue \nthe fleeing main villain or save an N PC they care \nabout or a group of innocents. \nThe adventurers must discover the main villain\'s \nsecret weakness before they can hope to defeat that \nvillain. \n6. PLAN E NC OUNTERS \n.:..fter you\'ve created the location and the overall story of \nthe adventure, it\'s time to plan out the encounters that \nmake up that adventure. In a location-based adventure, \nmost encounters are keyed to specific locations on \na map. For each room or wilderness area on the \nadventure map, your key describes what\'s in that area: \nits physical features, as well as any encounter that plays \nout there. The adventure key turns a simple sketch \nof numbered areas on graph paper into encounters \ndesigned to entertain and intrigue your players. \nSee "Creating Encounters" later in this chapter for \nguidance on crafting individual encounters. \nEVENT-BASED ADVENTURES \nIn an event-based adventure, the focus is on what the \ncharacters and villains do and what happens as a \nresult. The question of where those things happen is of \nsecondary importance. \nBuilding an event-based adventure is more work than \nbuilding a location-based one, but the process can be \nsimplified by following a number of straightforward \nsteps. Several steps include tables from which you \ncan choose adventure elements or roll randomly for \ninspiration. As with location-based adventures, you don\'t \nnecessarily have to follow these steps in order. \n1. START WITH A VILLAIN \nPutting care into creating your villain will pay off later, \nsince the villain plays such a pivotal role in advancing \nthe story. Use the Adventure Villains table in the \nprevious section to get started, and use the information \nin chapter 4 to help flesh out the villain. \nFor example, your villain might be an undead creature \nseeking to avenge a past imprisonment or injury. An \ninteresting aspect of an undead villain is that this past \ninjury might have occurred centuries ago, inspiring \nrevenge against the descendants of those that harmed \nit. Imagine a vampire imprisoned by the members of a \nreligious order of knights, and who now seeks revenge \nagainst the current members of that order. \n2. DET ERMINE T HE VILLAIN\'S ACTIONS \nOnce you have a villain, it\'s time to determine what \nsteps the villain takes to achieve its goals. Create a \ntimeline showing what the villain does and when, \nassuming no interference from the adventurers. \nBuilding on the previous example, you might decide \nthat your vampire villain murders several knights. By \nslipping past locked doors in gaseous form, the vampire \nis able to make the deaths appear natural at first, but \nit soon becomes clear that a depraved killer is behind \nthe murders. \nIf you need additional inspiration, consider a few \ndifferent options for how the villain\'s actions unfold over \nthe course of the adventure. \nEVENT-BASED VILLAIN ACTIONS \nd6 \nType of Actions \nd6 \n2 \n3 \nBig event \nCrime spree \nGrowing \ncorruption \n4 \n5 \n6 \nType of Actions \nOne and done \nSerial crimes \nStep by step \nBig Event. The villain\'s plans come to fruition during \na festival, an astrological event, a holy (or unholy) rite, a \nroyal wedding, the birth of a child, or some similar fixed \ntime. The villain\'s activities up to that point are geared \ntoward preparation for this event. \nCrime Spree. The villain commits acts that become \nbolder and more heinous over time. A killer might start \nout by targeting the destitute in the city slums before \nmoving up to a massacre in the marketplace, increasing \nthe horror and the body count each time. \nCHAPTER 3 I CREATTNG ADVENTURES \n75 \n'},

  'text': "VAMPIRE VILLAIN \nGrowing Corruption. As time passes, the villain's \npower and influence grow, affecting more victims \nacross a larger area. This might take the form of armies \nconquering new territory, an evil cult recruiting new \nmembers, or a spreading plague. A pretender to the \nthrone might attempt to secure the support of the \nkingdom's nobility in the days or weeks leading up to a \ncoup, or a guild leader could corrupt the members of a \ntown council or bribe officers of the watch. \nOne and Done. The villain commits a single crime \nand then tries to avoid the consequences. Instead of an \nCHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADYENTURES \nongoing plan to commit more crimes, the villain's goal is \nto lie low or flee the scene. \nSerial Crimes. The villain commits crimes one after \nthe other, but these acts are repetitive in nature, rather \nthan escalating to greater heights of depravity. The \ntrick to catching such a villain lies in determining the \npattern underlying the crimes. Though serial killers are \na common example of this type of villain, your villain \ncould be a serial arsonist favoring a certain type of \nbuilding, a magical sickness that affects spellcasters \nwho cast a specific spell, a thief that targets a certain \nkind of merchant, or a doppelganger kidnapping and \nimpersonating one noble after another. \nStep by Step. In pursuit of its goal, the villain carries \nout a specific set of actions in a particular sequence. \nA wizard might steal the items needed to create a \nphylactery and become a lich, or a cultist might kidnap \nthe priests of seven good-aligned gods as a sacrifice. \nAlternatively, the villain could be following a trail to find \nthe object of its revenge, killing one victim after another \nwhile moving ever closer to the real target. \n3. DETERMINE THE PARTY'S GOALS \nYou can use the Event-Based Goals table to set the \nparty's goal. A goal can also suggest ways in which the \nadventurers become caught up in the villain's plans, and \nwhat exactly they must do to foil those plans. \nEVENT-BASED GOALS \nd20 \nGoal \nBring the villain to justice. \n2 \nClear the name of an innocent N PC. \n3 \nProtect or hide an N PC. \n4 \nProtect an object. \n5 \nDiscover the nature and origin of a strange \nphenomenon that might be the villain's doing. \n6 \nFind a wanted fugitive. \n7 \nOverthrow a tyrant. \n8 \nUncover a conspiracy to overthrow a ruler. \n9 \nNegotiate peace between enemy nations or feuding \nfamilies. \n10 \nSecure aid from a ruler or council. \n11 \nHelp a villain find redemption. \n12 \nl3 \n14 \n15 \nParley with a villain. \nSmuggle weapons to rebel forces. \nStop a band of smugglers. \nGather intelligence on an enemy force. \n16 \nWin a tournament. \n17 \nDetermine the villain's identity. \n18 \nLocate a stolen item. \n19 \nMake sure a wedding goes off without a hitch. \n20 \nRoll twice, ignoring results of 20. \nFor example, you roll a 10 on the table, indicating that \nthe party's goal is to secure aid from a ruler or council. \nYou decide to connect that to the leadership of the order \ntargeted by your vampire villain. Maybe the order's \nleaders have a chest of jewels stolen from the vampire \ncenturies ago, and the characters can use the chest as \nbait to trap the villain. \n"},

  'text': '-= · I DENTIFY IMPORTANT NPCs \n~a ny event-based adventures require a well-detailed \n;-t of NPCs. Some of these NPCs fall neatly into the \n:. egories of allies and patrons, but most are likely to \n:-:: characters or creatures whose attitudes toward the \n~ .&gt;.-e nturers remain undecided until the adventurers \n-:.ceract with them. (See chapter 4 for more information \n;:J. creating NPCs.) \nThe elements of the adventure you\'ve determined \n: J far should provide a clear idea of what supporting \n:~.a racters you need to create, as well as how much \n:::: ail you need to generate for each one. NPCs unlikely \nJ become involved in combat don\'t need full combat \n:::atistics, for example, just as characters heavily \n::\';olved in negotiation could have ideals, bonds, and \n.:aws. If it\'s helpful, roll on the Adventure Allies or \n-. venture Patrons tables (in the "Location-Based \n~- ,·entures" section, earlier in this chapter). \n- . ANTICIPATE THE VILLAIN\'S REACTIONS \n\'-.s the adventurers pursue their goals and foil the \n:.:lain\'s plans, how does the villain respond? Does it \na-h out in violence or send dire warnings? Does it \nClOk for simple solutions to its problems or create more \n:omplicated schemes to route around interference? \nLook over the villain\'s actions that you outlined in \n:;·ep 2. For each event arising from those actions, think \nabout how the adventurers are likely to react. If they \n:an prevent an action or hamper its success, what effect \n::oes that have on the villain\'s overall plan? What can \n·ae villain do to compensate? \nOne way to track a villain\'s reactions is by using a \n:\':owchart. This might grow out of the timeline that \n;:!escribes the villain\'s plans, outlining how the villain \ngets back on track after the adventurers thwart its plans. \nOr the flowchart could be separate from the timeline, \n·hawing the various actions the adventurers might take \nand the villain\'s response to those actions. \n6. DETAIL KEY LOCATIONS \n~ ince locations aren\'t the focus of the adventure, they \nan be simpler and smaller than a dungeon complex \nor an expanse of wilderness. They might be specific \n. ocations in a city, or even individual rooms in locations \n·,yhere combat is likely to break out or significant \nexploration is needed, such as a throne room, a guild \n~ eadquarters , a vampire\'s crumbling manor, or a \n~ ights\' chapter house. \n7. CHOOSE AN INTRODUCTION AND A CLIMAX \nThe Adventure Introduction table in the "Location-\nBased Adventures" section offers fun possibilities \n:or hooking the characters into the events of your \nadventure, including dreams, hauntings, and a simple \nplea for help. The Adventure Climax table in that same \n-ection includes adventure endings that work just as \nwell for event-based adventures. \nFor example, the Adventure Introduction table helps \nyou decide that an ally the adventurers care about needs \ntheir help. Perhaps the NPC is a knight who believes \nthat a vampire is trying to kill him, or a friend or relative \nhoping to find the knight\'s murderer. This NPC brings \nthe vampire\'s crimes to the characters\' attention. \nLooking over the Adventure Climax table, you might \ndecide to have the adventurers bait the vampire with a \nchest of jewels stolen from its lair. As an added twist, \nyou decide that the vampire\'s true goal is to retrieve a \nnecklace among the jewels. The necklace is set with \nnine gems, and with these gems the vampire can open \na gate to the Nine Hells. Should the vampire succeed, \nthe adventurers will have a more pressing threat to deal \nwith, as a powerful devil steps through the gate and \nhonors some ancient pact it made with the vampire. \n8. PLAN ENCOUNTERS \nAfter you\'ve created the overall story of the adventure, \nit\'s time to plan out the encounters on which the \nevents of that adventure will hang. In an event-based \nadventure, encounters occur when the villain\'s agenda \nintersects the path of the characters. You can\'t always \nanticipate exactly when or where that will happen, but \nyou can create a list of possible encounters that the \nadventurers might experience. This can take the form of \ngeneral descriptions of the villain\'s forces, details of its \nlieutenants and minions, as well as encounters tied to \nthe key locations of the adventure. \nSee "Creating Encounters" later in this chapter for \nguidance on crafting individual encounters. \nMYSTERIES \nA mystery is a form of event-based adventure that \nusually focuses on the adventurers\' efforts to solve a \ncrime, usually a robbery or murder. Unlike the writer of \na mystery novel, a Dungeon Master can\'t always predict \nwhat the characters will do in a mystery adventure. \nA villain whose actions are "crime spree," "one and \ndone," or "serial crimes" might inspire you to craft \na mystery adventure around that villain\'s crimes. \nSimilarly, if the adventurers\' goals include determining \nthe villain\'s identity, that might be part of a mystery. \nTo build a mystery adventure, follow the steps for \ncreating any event-based adventure. Then consider \nthree additional elements for the adventure: the victim, \nthe suspects, and the clues . \nVICTIM \nThink about the victim\'s relationship to the villain. \nThough you can create a strong scenario with no such \nrelationship, part of what makes a mystery exciting is \nthe discovery of the twisted connections between NPCs \nand how those connections led to the crime. A random \nkilling might be just as mysterious, but it lacks that \nemotional connection. \nAlso look for a connection between the victim and one \nor more of the adventurers. One surefire way to draw \nadventurers into a mystery- including making them \nsuspects- is to make the victim someone with whom the \ncharacters are acquainted. \nSUSPECTS \nYour cast of characters should include an assortment \nof other NPCs who didn\'t commit the crime, but who \nhad the motive, the means, or the opportunity to do so. \nCHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES \n77 \n'},

  'text': "Suspects might be obvious or could come to light during \nthe investigation. One technique often used in detective \nfiction is to create a closed circle of suspects-a finite \nnumber of individuals whose circumstances make them \nthe only possible suspects. \nOne tip for keeping the players and the adventurers \nguessing as to the identity of the villain is to ensure that \nmore than one suspect has a secret. When questioned \nby the adventurers, a suspect might appear nervous or \nattempt to lie, despite being innocent of the crime. A \nsecret business deal, an illicit affair, a dark past, or an \nuncontrolled vice are flaws that make suspects more \ninteresting than NPCs with nothing to hide. \nCLUES \nClues point to the identity of the villain. Some clues are \nverbal, including the statements of the suspects and \nwitnesses that help the adventurers develop a picture \nof what happened. Other clues are physical, such as an \nunfinished message written in the victim's blood, a piece \nof jewelry left behind by the villain, or a weapon found \nhidden in a suspect's room. \nA clue should connect a suspect to the crime, typically \nby shedding light on the suspect's motive, means, or \nopportunity. Some clues connect the wrong suspect \nto the crime, leading the adventurers in the wrong \ndirection. Eventually, they must find other clues pointing \nin a different direction, or come across evidence that \nabsolves the suspect. \nIt's better to populate your adventure with too many \nclues than too few. If the adventurers solve the mystery \ntoo quickly, you might feel some disappointment but \nthe players will feel a sense of accomplishment. If the \nmystery is too hard, though, the players will become \nfrustrated. Since you have to account for the possibility \nthat the adventurers will overlook some clues, use \nredundant clues to ensure that the players have the \nknowledge needed to catch the villain. \nINTRIGUE ----\nIntrigue adventures are event-based adventures that \nrevolve around power struggles. Intrigues are common \nin the courts of the nobility, but power struggles can \nplay out just as easily in merchants' guilds, crime \nsyndicates, and temple hierarchies. \nRather than dark events and villainous plots, an \nintrigue adventure typically revolves around the \nexchange of favors, the rise and fall of individuals \nin power and influence, and the honeyed words of \ndiplomacy. A prince's efforts to be named heir to the \nthrone, a courtier's ambition to sit at the queen's right \nhand, and a merchant's desire to open a trade route \nthrough enemy lands are the stuff of intrigue. \nLike all adventures, an intrigue adventure works only \nif the players and their characters are invested in the \noutcome. If no one cares who the king's chamberlain is \nor who has logging rights in the elven woods, throwing \nthe characters into an adventure centered on those \nissues will fall fiat. However, if having the ear of the \nking's chamberlain means the characters can use royal \nsoldiers to help them defend their own stronghold on the \nborderlands, players will be invested in the scenario. \nCHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES \nAdventurers usually become embroiled in intrigue \nwhen they need a favor from a powerful creature and \nhave to perform a favor in exchange, or when the plots \nof powerful NP Cs get in the way of the characters \nachieving their goals. Some of the event-based goals \ndiscussed earlier in this section lend themselves to \nintrigue adventures. For example, if the adventurers \nmust uncover a conspiracy, negotiate a peace treaty, or \nsecure aid from a ruler or council, you might be looking \nat an intrigue adventure. \nThe process of creating an intrigue adventure is \nsimilar to creating any other event-based adventure, \nwith two main differences: how villains are handled and \nhow the characters can gain influence. \nVILLAINS \nSome intrigue adventures are driven by the actions of a \nsingle villain, such as a noble plotting the assassination \nof a monarch. However, an intrigue adventure can have \nmultiple villains or no villain at all. \nNo Villain. Some intrigue adventures revolve around \nthe exchange of favors in the absence of a villain. For \nthis type of adventure, skip steps 1 and 2 of the event-\nbased adventure creation process (the villain and the \nvillain's actions) and move straight to the adventurers' \ngoals in step 3. Figure out why the adventurers become \ninvolved in the intrigue, then spend the bulk of your time \ncreating the NPCs they interact with. \nMany Villains. Some intrigue adventures feature \na whole cast of villains, each with its own goals, \nmotivations, and methods. The adventurers might be \ndrawn into the struggle of a court full of nobles vying \nfor the throne in the wake of the king's sudden death, \nor could find themselves negotiating the end to a deadly \nturf war among thieves' guilds. In this scenario, you'll \nspend a lot of time on steps 1 and 2, developing each of \nthe major NPCs as a distinct villain with an agenda. \nIn step 5, you'll need to develop each villain's reactions \nto the potential setbacks they face during the adventure. \nHowever, you don't need to put equal effort into detailing \nthe reactions of every villain, since many will likely \necho each other or cancel each other out. Whenever \nthe adventurers foil one villain's plans, it might let \nanother villain's schemes move forward, advancing the \nadventure whether the foiled villain reacts or not. \nINFLUENCE \nDepending on the scenario, you might want to track \nthe party's influence with different NPCs or factions, or \neven track influence separately for each character. \nOne way to handle influence is to treat it like \ninspiration. A character gains influence in a certain \nsituation only if you grant it, and bringing influence \ninto play requires spending it. Characters can gain \ninfluence by doing favors for NPCs, advancing the \ncause of an organization, or demonstrating their power \nand heroism, at your discretion. As with inspiration, \na character can choose to spend influence to gain \nadvantage on a roll relevant to that influence. \nAnother way to handle influence is to treat it like \nrenown (see chapter 1), allowing characters to gain \nrenown at court and within various key factions. \n"},

The \nadventurers must choose the NPC that is most likely to \nhelp them accomplish their goal. \nFriend Quandary. An NPC that one or more of the \ncharacters cares about makes an impossible demand \nCHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES \non the characters. A love interest might demand that \na character turn away from a dangerous quest. A \ndear friend might plead with the characters to spare \nthe villain's life, to prove that they are better than the \nvillain. A weak NPC might beg for a chance to win favor \nfrom the characters by undertaking a dangerous but \nessential mission. \nHonor Quandary. A character is forced to choose \nbetween victory and a personal oath or code of honor. \nA paladin who has sworn the Oath of Virtue might \nrealize that the clearest path to success lies in deceit \nand subterfuge. A Joyal cleric might be tempted to \ndisobey the orders of his or her faith. If you present \nthis quandary, be sure to provide an opportunity for a \ncharacter to atone for violating his or her oath. \nRescue Quandary.

Second, it shouldn\'t be burden for you to \n:un. Beyond that, a well-crafted encounter usually has \na straightforward objective as well as some connection \nto the overarching story of your campaign, building on \nthe encounters that precede it while foreshadowing \nencounters yet to come. \nAn encounter has one of three possible outcomes: \n!he characters succeed, the characters partly succeed, \nor the characters faiL The encounter needs to account \nfor all three possibilities, and the outcome needs to \nhave consequences so that the players feel like their \nsuccesses and failures matter. \nCHARACTER OBJECTIVES \nWhen players don\'t know what they\'re supposed to do \nin a given encounter, anticipation and excitement can \nquickly turn to boredom and frustration. A transparent \nobjective alleviates the risk of players losing interest. \nFor example, if the overall story of your adventure \ninvolves a quest to deliver a priceless relic to a remote \nmonastery, each encounter along the way is an \nopportunity to introduce a smaller objective that moves \nthe quest forward. Encounters during the trip might \nsee the adventurers accosted by enemies determined \nto steal the relic, or by monsters that are constantly \nthreatening the monastery. \nSome players create their own objectives, which is to \nbe expected and encouraged. It is, after all, as much the \nplayers\' campaign as yours. For example, a character \nmight try to bribe enemies rather than fight them, \nor chase after a fleeing enemy to see where it goes. \nPlayers who ignore objectives will have to deal with \nthe consequences, which is another important facet of \nencounter design. \n: -~-.• ~?=-~ OE ~~ c-:- ::T =: s \n~ ~e io owing objectiYes can be u ed as fou ndations \nfor encounter . Although these objectives focus on a \nsingle encounter during an adventure, using the same \nobjective in multiple encounters allows you to combine \nthose encounters into a larger obstacle or problem the \nadventurers must overcome. \nMake Peace. The characters must convince two \nopposing groups (or their leaders) to end the conflict \nthat embroils them. As a complication, the characters \nmight have enemies on one or both of the opposing \nsides, or some other group or individual might be \ninstigating the conflict to further its own ends. \nProtect an NPC or Object. The characters must act \nas bodyguards or protect some object in their custody. \nAs a complication, the NPC under the party\'s protection \nmight be cursed, diseased, prone to panic attacks, too \nyoung or too old to fight, or apt to risk the lives of the \nadventurers through dubious decisions. The object the \nadventurers have sworn to protect might be sentient, \ncursed, or difficult to transport. \nRetrieve an Object. The adventurers must gain \npossession of a specific object in the area of the \nencounter, preferably before combat finishes. As a \ncomplication, enemies might desire the object as much \nas the adventurers do, forcing both parties to fight for it. \nRun a Gauntlet. The adventurers must pass through \na dangerous area. This objective is similar to retrieving \nan object insofar as reaching the exit is a higher priority \nthan killing opponents in the area. A time limit adds a \ncomplication, as does a decision point that might lead \ncharacters astray. Other complications include traps, \nhazards, and monsters. \nSneak In. The adventurers need to move through the \nencounter area without making their enemies aware \nof their presence. Complications might ensue if they \nare detected. \nStop a Ritual. The plots of evil cult leaders, \nmalevolent warlocks, and powerful fiends often involve \nrituals that must be foiled. Characters engaged in \nstopping a ritual must typically fight their way through \nevil minions before attempting to disrupt the ritual\'s \npowerful magic. As a complication, the ritual might \nbe close to completion when the characters arrive, \nimposing a time limit. Depending on the ritual, its \ncompletion might have immediate consequences as welL \nTake Out a Single Target. The villain is surrounded \nby minions powerful enough to kill the adventurers. \nThe characters can flee and hope to confront the villain \nanother day, or they can try to fight their way through \nthe minions to take out their target. As a complication, \nthe minions might be innocent creatures under the \nvillain\'s controL Killing the villain means breaking that \ncontrol, but the adventurers must endure the minions\' \nattacks until they do. \nCREATING A COMBAT ENCOUNTER \nWhen creating a combat encounter, let your imagination \nrun wild and build something your players will enjoy. \nOnce you have the details figured out, use this section to \nadjust the difficulty of the encounter. \nCHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES \n8T \n'},

  'text': "COMBAT ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY \nThere are four categories of encounter difficulty. \nEasy. An easy encounter doesn't tax the characters' \nresources or put them in serious peril. They might lose \na few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed. \nMedium. A medium encounter usually has one or \ntwo scary moments for the players, but the characters \nshould emerge victorious with no casualties. One or \nmore of them might need to use healing resources. \nHard. A hard encounter could go badly for the \nadventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out \nof the fight, and there's a slim chance that one or more \ncharacters might die. \nDeadly. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or \nmore player characters. Survival often requires good \ntactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat. \nXP THRESHOLDS BY CHARACTER LEVEL \nCharacter \nEncounter Difficulty \nLevel \nEasy \nMedium \nHard \nDeadly \nlst \n25 \n50 \n75 \n100 \n2nd \n50 \n100 \n150 \n200 \n3rd \n75 \n150 \n225 \n400 \n4th \n125 \n250 \n375 \n500 \n5th \n250 \n500 \n750 \n1,100 \n6th \n300 \n600 \n900 \n1,400 \n7th \n350 \n750 \n1,100 \n1,700 \n8th \n450 \n900 \n1,400 \n2,100 \n9th \n550 \n1,100 \n1,600 \n2,400 \nlOth \n600 \n1,200 \n1,900 \n2,800 \nllth \n800 \n1,600 \n2,400 \n3,600 \n12th \n1,000 \n2,000 \n3,000 \n4,500 \n13th \n1,100 \n2,200 \n3,400 \n5,100 \n14th \n1,250 \n2,500 \n3,800 \n5,700 \n15th \n1,400 \n2,800 \n4,300 \n6,400 \n16th \n1,600 \n3,200 \n4,800 \n7,200 \n17th \n2,000 \n3,900 \n5,900 \n8,800 \n18th \n2,100 \n4,200 \n6,300 \n9,500 \n19th \n2,400 \n4,900 \n7,300 \n10,900 \n20th \n2,800 \n5,700 \n8,500 \n12,700 \nCHALLENGE RATING \nWhen putting together an encounter or adventure, especially \nat lower levels, exercise caution when using monsters whose \nchallenge rating is higher than the party's average level. Such \na creature might deal enough damage with a single action to \ntake out adventurers of a lower level. For example, an ogre \nhas a challenge rating of 2, but it can kill a l st-level wizard \nwith a single blow. \nIn addition, some monsters have features that might be \ndifficult or impossible for lower-level characters to overcome. \nFor example, a rakshasa has a challenge rating of 13 and is \nimmune to spells of 6th level and lower. Spellcasters of 12th \nlevel or lower have no spells higher than 6th level, mean ing \nthat they won't be able to affect the rakshasa with their \nmagic, putting the adventurers at a serious disadvantage. \nSuch an encounter would be significantly tougher for the \nparty than the monster's challenge rating might suggest. \nCHAPTER 3 I C REATI NG ADVENTURES \nEVALUATING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY \nUse the following method to gauge the difficulty of any \ncombat encounter. \n1. Determine XP Thresholds. First, determine the \nexperience point (XP) thresholds for each character in \nthe party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table \nbelow has four XP thresholds for each character level, \none for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a \ncharacter's level to determine his or her XP thresholds. \nRepeat this process for every character in the party. \n2. Determine the Party's XP Threshold. For each \ncategory of encounter difficulty, add up the characters' \nXP thresholds. This determines the party's XP \nthreshold. You'll end up with four totals, one for each \ncategory of encounter difficulty. \nFor example, if your party includes three 3rd-level \ncharacters and one 2nd-level character, the party's \ntotaled XP thresholds would be as follows: \nEasy: 275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50) \nMedium: 550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + l 00) \nHard: 825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150) \nDeadly: l ,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200) \nRecord the totals, because you can use them for every \nencounter in your adventure. \n3. Total the Monsters' XP. Add up the XP for all of \nthe monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP \nvalue in its stat block. \n4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters. If the \nencounter includes more than one monster, apply \na multiplier to the monsters' total XP. The more \nmonsters there are, the more attack rolls you're making \nagainst the characters in a given round, and the more \ndangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge \nan encounter's difficulty, multiply the total XP of all \nthe monsters in the encounter by the value given in the \nEncounter Multipliers table. \nFor example, if an encounter includes four monsters \nworth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP \nof the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. \nThis adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth \nin terms of XP; the adjusted value's only purpose is to \nhelp you accurately assess the encounter's difficulty. \nWhen making this calculation, don't count any \nmonsters whose challenge rating is significantly below \nthe average challenge rating of the other monsters in the \ngroup unless you think the weak monsters significantly \ncontribute to the difficulty of the encounter. \nENCOUNTER MULTIPLIERS \nNumber of \nNumber of \nMonsters \nMultiplier \nMonsters \nMultiplier \nX l \n7-10 \nX 2.5 \n2 \nxl.S \nll - 14 \nx3 \n3- 6 \nx2 \n15 or more \nx4 \n5. Compare XP. Compare the monsters' adjusted XP \nvalue to the party's XP thresholds. The closest threshold \nthat is lower than the adjusted XP value of the monsters \ndetermines the encounter's difficulty. \n"},

As a rule, if the adjusted \nXP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is \nhigher than one-third of the party\'s expected XP total \nfor the adventuring day (see "The Adventuring Day," \nbelow), the encounter is going to be tougher than the \nsum of its parts. \nBUILDING ENCOUNTERS ON A BUDGET \nYou can build an encounter if you know its desired \ndifficulty.

  'text': "medium, hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember \nthat groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than \ntheir base XP values would indicate (see step 4). \nFor example, using the party from step 2, you can \nbuild a medium encounter by making sure that the \nadjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP \n(the party's threshold for a medium encounter) and \nno more than 825 XP (the party's threshold for a hard \nencounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such \nas a manticore or owl bear) is worth 700 XP, so that's \none possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each \none will count for 1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of \ndire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP \nvalue of 600, making them a medium encounter for the \nparty as well. \nTo assist with this approach, appendix B presents a \nlist of all monsters in the Monster Manual organized by \nchallenge rating. \nTHE ADVENTURING DAY \nAssuming typical adventuring conditions and average \nluck, most adventuring parties can handle about six \nto eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the \nadventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers \ncan get through more. If it has more deadly encounters, \nthey can handle fewer. \nIn the same way you figure out the difficulty of an \nencounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and \nother opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how \nfar the party is likely to progress. \nFor each character in the party, use the Adventuring \nDay XP table to estimate how much XP that character is \nexpected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all \nparty members to get a total for the party's adventuring \nday. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP \nvalue for encounters the party can handle before the \ncharacters will need to take a long rest. \nADVENTURING DAY XP \nAdjusted XP per Day \nAdjusted XP per Day \nLevel \nper Character \nLevel \nper Character \n1st \n300 \n11th \n10,500 \n2nd \n600 \n12th \n11,500 \n3rd \n1,200 \n13th \n13,500 \n4th \n1,700 \n14th \n15,000 \n5th \n3,500 \n15th \n18,000 \n6th \n4,000 \n16th \n20,000 \n7th \n5,000 \n17th \n25,000 \n8th \n6,000 \n18th \n27,000 \n9th \n7,500 \n19th \n30,000 \nlOth \n9,000 \n20th \n40,000 \nSHORT RESTS \nIn general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the \nparty will likely need to take two short rests, about one-\nthird and two-thirds of the way through the day. \nMODIFYING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY \nAn encounter can be made easier or harder based on \nthe choice of location and the situation. \n"},

When \na random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult \n&lt;he table to determine what the party encounters. \nSome players and DMs view random encounters in an \nadventure as time-wasters, yet well-designed random \nencounters can serve a variety of useful purposes: \nCreate urgency. Adventurers don\'t tend to dawdle \nif the threat of random encounters is hanging over \ntheir heads. Wanting to avoid wandering monsters \ncreates a strong incentive to look for a safe place to \nrest. (Rolling dice behind the DM screen can often \naccomplish this even without an actual encounter.) \nEstablish atmosphere. The appearance of \nthematically linked creatures as random encounters \nhelps to create a consistent tone and atmosphere \nfor an adventure. For example, an encounter table \nfilled with bats, wraiths, giant spiders, and zombies \ncreates a sense of horror, and tells the adventurers to \nprepare for battle with even more powerful creatures \nof the night. \nDrain character resources. Random encounters can \ndrain the party\'s hit points and spell slots, leaving the \nadventurers feeling underpowered and vulnerable. \nThis creates tension, as players are forced to make \ndecisions based on the fact that their characters aren\'t \nat full strength. \nProvide assistance. Some random encounters can \nbenefit the characters instead of hindering or harming \nthem. Helpful creatures or NPCs might provide the \nadventurers with useful information or assistance \nwhen they need it most. \nAdd interest. Random encounters can reveal details \nabout your world. They can foreshadow danger or \nprovide hints that will help the adventurers prepare \nfor the encounters to come. \n• Reinforce campaign themes. Random encounters \ncan remind the players of the major themes of the \ncampaign. For example, if your campaign features an \nongoing war between two nations, you might design \nrandom encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present \nnature of the conflict. In friendly territory, your tables \nmight include bedraggled troops returning from bat-\ntle, refugees fleeing invading forces, heavily guarded \ncaravans full of weapons, and lone messengers on \nhorseback riding for the front lines. While charac-\nters are in hostile territory, the tables might include \nbattlefields littered with the recently slain, armies of \nevil humanoids on the march, and improvised gib-\nbets holding the bodies of deserters who tried to flee \nthe conflict. \nRandom encounters should never be tiresome to you \nor your players. You don\'t want the players to feel as if \nthey aren\'t making progress because another random \nencounter brings their progress to a halt whenever they \ntry to move forward. Likewise, you don\'t want to spend \ntime distracted by random encounters that add nothing \nto the adventure narrative or that interfere with the \noverall pace you\'re trying to set. \nNot every DM likes to use random encounters. You \nmight find that they distract from your game or are \notherwise causing more trouble than you want. If \nrandom encounters don\'t work for you, don\'t use them. \nTRIGGERING RANDOM ENCOUNTERS \nBecause you want random encounters to build on the \nintended narrative of a game session, not compete with \nit, you should choose the placement of those encounters \ncarefully. Think about a random encounter under any of \nthe following circumstances: \nThe players are getting off track and slowing \ndown the game. \nThe characters stop for a short or long rest. \n• The characters are undertaking a long, \nuneventful journey. \nThe characters draw attention to themselves when \nthey should be keeping a low profile. \nCHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES \n'},

  'text': '86 \n\\ \nCHECKING FOR RANDOM ENCOUNTERS \nYou decide when a random encounter happens, or you \nroll. Consider checking for a random encounter once \nevery hour, once every 4 to 8 hours, or once during the \nday and once during a long rest-whatever makes the \nmost sense based on how active the area is. \nIf you roll, do so with a d20. If the result is 18 or \nhigher, a random encounter occurs. You then roll on an \nappropriate random encounter table to determine what \nthe adventurers meet, rerolling if the die result doesn\'t \nmake sense given the circumstances. \nRandom encounter tables might be provided as part \nof the adventure you\'re running, or you can use the \ninformation in this chapter to build your own. Creating \nyour own tables is the best way to reinforce the themes \nand flavor of your home campaign. \nNot every run-in with another creature counts as \na random encounter. Encounter tables don\'t usually \ninclude rabbits hopping through the undergrowth, \nharmless rats scurrying through dungeon halls, or \naverage citizens walking through the streets of a city. \nRandom encounter tables present obstacles and events \nthat advance the plot, foreshadow important elements or \nthemes of the adventure, and provide fun distractions. \nCHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES \nCREATI NG R AN DOM E NCOUNTER TABLES \nCreating your own random encounter tables is \nstraightforward. Determine what sort of encounters \nmight occur in a given dungeon area, figure out the \nlikelihood of a particular encounter occurring, then \narrange the results. An "encounter" in this case could be \na single monster or NPC, a group of monsters or NPCs, \na random event (such as an earth tremor or a parade), \nor a random discovery (such as a charred corpse or a \nmessage scrawled on a wall). \nAssemble Your Encounters. Once you\'ve established \na location through which the adventurers are likely to \npass, be it a wilderness area or dungeon complex, make \na list of creatures that might be found wandering there. \nIf you\'re not sure which creatures to include, appendix B \nhas lists of monsters organized by terrain type. \nFor a sylvan woodland, you might create a table \nthat includes centaurs, faerie dragons, pixies, sprites, \ndryads, satyrs, blink dogs, elks, owlbears, treants, giant \nowls, and a unicorn. If elves inhabit the forest, the table \nmight also include elf druids and elf scouts. Perhaps \ngnolls are threatening the woods, so adding gnolls and \nhyenas to the table would be a fun surprise for players. \nAnother fun surprise would be a wandering predator, \nsuch as a displacer beast that likes to hunt blink dogs. \nThe table could also use a few random encounters of \na less monstrous nature, such as a grove of burned \ntrees (the handiwork of the gnolls), an ivy-covered \nelven statue, and a plant with glowing berries that turn \ncreatures invisible when ingested. \nWhen choosing monsters for a random encounter \ntable, try to imagine why the monsters would be \nencountered outside their lairs. What is each monster \nup to? Is it on patrol? Hunting for food? Searching for \nsomething? Also consider whether a creature is moving \nstealthily as it travels through the area. \nAs with planned encounters, random encounters \nare more interesting when they happen in memorable \nlocations. Outdoors the adventurers might be crossing \na forest clearing when they encounter a unicorn or \nbe pushing through a dense section of forest when \nthey come across a nest of spiders. Crossing a desert, \ncharacters might discover an oasis haunted by wights or \na rocky outcropping on which a blue dragon perches. \nProbabilities. A random encounter table can be \ncreated in a number of ways, ranging from simple (roll \nld6 for one of six possible encounters) to complicated \n(roll percentile dice, modify for time of day, and cross-\nindex the modified number with the dungeon level). The \nsample encounter table presented here uses a range of \n2 to 20 (nineteen entries total), generated using 1d12 \n+ 1d8. The probability curve ensures that encounters \nappearing in the middle of the table are more likely to \noccur than encounters placed at the beginning or end \nof the table. A roll of 2 or 20 is rare (about a 1 percent \nchance of either), while each of the rolls from 9 to 13 \noccurs a little over 8 percent of the time. \nThe Sylvan Forest Encounters table is an example \nof a random encounter table that implements the ideas \nmentioned above. Creature names in bold refer to stat \nblocks that appear in the Monster Manual. \n'},

A 1st-level party of \nadventurers could have a random encounter with a \nyoung dragon circling above a forest canopy in search \nof a quick meal, but the characters should have the \noption to hide or bargain for their lives if the dragon \nspots them.

As you\'ll see, ten sentences can sum up \nhe main elements of a memorable NPC, one sentence \n·or each of the following: \nOccupation and history \nAppearance \nAbilities \nTalent \nMannerism \nInteractions with others \nUseful knowledge \nIdeal \nBond \nFlaw or secret \nAlthough the material here focuses on humanoid \n_·pes, you can adjust details to create monstrous \n_ \'PCs as well. \nOCCUPATION AND HISTORY \nIn one sentence, describe the NPC\'s occupation \nand provide a brief historical note that hints at the \ncharacter\'s past. For example, the NPC might have \n-erved in an army, been imprisoned for a crime, or \nadventured years ago. \nAPPEARANCE \nIn one sentence, describe the NPC\'s most distinctive \nphysical features. You can roll on the NPC Appearance \ntable or choose a feature that suits the character. \nNPC APPEARANCE \nd20 \nFeature \nDistinctive jewelry: earrings, necklace, circlet, \nbracelets \n2 \nPiercings \n3 \nFlamboyant or outlandish clothes \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n·g \n9 \n10 \nll \n12 \nl3 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \nFormal, clean clothes \nRagged, dirty clothes \nPronounced scar \nMissing teeth \nMissing fingers \nUnusual eye color (or two different colors) \nTattoos \nBirthmark \nUnusual skin color \nBald \nBraided beard or hair \nUnusual hair color \nNervous eye twitch \nDistinctive nose \nDistinctive posture (crooked or rigid) \nExceptionally beautiful \nExceptionally ugly \nABILITIES \nYou don\'t need to roll ability scores for the NPC, but \nnote abilities that are above or below average- great \nstrength or monumental stupidity, for example- and use \nthem to inform the NPC\'s qualities. \nNPC ABILITIES \nd6 \nHigh Ability \nStrength-powerful, brawny, strong as an ox \n2 \nDexterity-lithe, agile, graceful \n3 \nConstitution-hardy, hale, healthy \n4 \nIntelligence-studious, learned, inquisitive \n5 \nWisdom-perceptive, spiritual, insightful \n6 \nd6 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \nCharisma-persuasive, forceful, born leader \nLow Ability \nStrength-feeble, scrawny \nDexterity-clumsy, fumbling \nConstitution-sickly, pale \nIntelligence-dim-witted, slow \nWisdom-oblivious, absentminded \nCharisma-dull, boring \nCHAPTER 4 I CREATING NONPLAYER CHARACTERS \n8g \n'},

  'text': 'time to give it a bit of background, a distinctive quirk of \nappearance, and especially an ideal, a bond, and a flaw. \nAs an example, consider the Xanathar, a beholder \nthat runs extensive criminal operations in the city of \nWaterdeep. The Xanathar\'s spherical body is covered in \nleathery flesh with a texture similar to cobblestones. Its \neyes talks are jointed like the legs of an insect, and some \nof the stalks have magic rings on them. The Xanathar\'s \nspeech is slow and deliberate, and it prefers to turn its \ncentral eye away from creatures it speaks to. Like all \nbeholders, it sees other creatures as inferiors, though \nit understands the usefulness of its humanoid minions. \nThe Xanathar uses the sewers beneath Waterdeep to \naccess virtually any location within or under the city. \nThe Xanathar\'s ideal is greed. It craves powerful \nmagic items and surrounds itself with gold, platinum, \nand precious gems. Its bond is to its lair-an elaborate \ncavern complex carved out between the twisting sewers \nofWaterdeep, which it inherited from its predecessors \nand cherishes above all else. Its flaw is a weakness for \nexotic pleasures: finely prepared foods, scented oils, and \nrare spices and herbs. \nEstablishing this information allows you to play the \nXanathar as more than an ordinary beholder. The \ncomplexities of the creature\'s characterization create \nmore memorable interaction and interesting story \npossibilities. \nNPC STATISTICS \nWhen you give an NPC game statistics, you have three \nmain options: giving the NPC only the few statistics it \nneeds, give the NPC a monster stat block, or give the \nNPC a class and levels. The latter two options require a \nbit of explanation. \n/ \nUSING A MONSTER S-TAT BLOCK \nAppendix B of the l}f-&lt;:fnster Manual contains statistics \nfor many gen~;pe-i"fPCs that you can customize as you \nee-fit;"affi!Chapter 9 of this book offers guidelines on \nadjusting their statistics and creating a new stat block. \nUSING CLASSES AND LEVELS \nYou can create an NPC just as you would a player \ncharacter, using the rules in the Player\'s Handbook. \nYou can even use a character sheet to keep track of the \nNPC\'s vital information. \nClass Options. In addition to the class options in the \nPlayer\'s Handbook, two additional class options are \navailable for evil player characters and NPCs: the Dea ._ \ndomain for clerics and the oathbreaker for paladins. \nBoth options are detailed at the end of this chapter. \nEquipment. Most NPCs don\'t need an exhaustive lis \nof equipment. An enemy meant to be faced in combat \nrequires weapons and armor, plus any treasure the \nNPC carries (including magic items that might be used \nagainst the adventurers). \nChallenge Rating. An NPC built for combat needs a \nchallenge rating. Use the rules in chapter 9 to determin \nthe NPC\'s challenge rating, just as you would for a \nmonster you designed. \nNPC PARTY MEMBERS \nNPCs might join the adventuring party because they \nwant a share of the loot and are willing to accept \nan equal share of the risk, or they might follow the \nadventurers because of a bond of loyalty, gratitude, \nor love. Such NPCs are controlled by you, or you \ncan transfer control to the players. Even if a player \ncontrols an NPC, it\'s up to you to make sure the NPC i \nportrayed as a character in his or her own right, not jus· \nas a servant that the players can manipulate for their \nown benefit. \nAny NPC that accompanies the adventurers acts as \na party member and earns a full share of experience \npoints. When determining the difficulty of a combat \nencounter (see chapter 3), make sure to include all NPC \nparty members. \nLow-LEVEL FoLLOWERS \nYour campaign might allow player characters to take on \nlower-level NPCs as followers. For example, a paladin \nmight have a 1st-level paladin as a squire, a wizard \nmight accept a 2nd-level wizard as an apprentice, a \ncleric might choose (or be assigned) a 3rd-level cleric as \nan acolyte, and a bard might take on a 4th-level bard as \nan understudy. \nOne advantage of allowing lower-level characters to \njoin the party is that players have backup characters if \ntheir main characters take time off, retire, or die. One \ndisadvantage is that you and your players have more \nparty members to account for. \nSince lower-level NPC party members receive equal \nparty shares of XP, they will gain levels more quickly \nthan the adventurers (the benefit of studying under such \nexperienced masters), and might eventually catch up to \nthem. It also means the adventurers\' advancement is \nslowed somewhat, as they must share their XP with an \nNPC shouldering only part of the adventuring burden. \nPowerful monsters that are an appropriate challenge \nfor higher-level characters can deal enough damage to \ninstantly kill or incapacitate a low-level follower. The \nadventurers should expect to spend effort and resources \n'},

  'text': "protecting lower-level NPC party members and to \nprovide healing when this protection fails. \nA DVENTURER NPCs \nIf you don't have enough players to form a full party, \n;·ou can use NPCs to fill out the ranks. These NPCs \n-hould be the same level as the lowest-level adventurer \nin the party and built (either by you or your players) \nusing the character creation and advancement rules in \nthe Player's Handbook. It's easiest on you if you let the \nplayers create and run these supporting characters. \nEncourage players to roleplay supporting characters \na true to the NPCs' personality traits, ideals, bonds, \nand flaws as possible, so that they don't come across \nautomatons. If you don't feel that an NPC is being \nportrayed well, you can take control of the NPC, give \ni to another player, or simply have the NPC leave \n~e party. \nJ PC supporting characters are easier to play if you \nimit their class options. Good candidates for supporting \ncharacters include a cleric with the Life domain, a \n-ghter with the Champion archetype, a rogue with the \n- hief archetype, and a wizard specializing in Evocation. \nO PTIONAL RULE: LOYALTY \n_oyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine \n· ow far an NPC party member will go to protect or \n--sist the other members of the party (even those \nshe doesn't particularly like). An NPC party \n·ho is abused or ignored is likely to abandon \n- e party, whereas an NPC who owes a life \nharacters or shares their goals might fight to the death \n:or them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by \nthis rule. \n:..oYALTY ScoRE \n_.\\n PC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from \nto 20. The NPC's maximum loyalty score is equal \n-o the highest Charisma score among all adventurers \nthe party, and its starting loyalty score is half that \number. If the highest Charisma score changes-\n;x:rhaps a character dies or leaves the group-adjust the \n-PC's loyalty score accordingly. \nTRA CKING LOYALTY \n'eep track of an NPC's loyalty score in secret so that \n- e players won't know for sure whether an NPC party \n~ember is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently \n:mder a player's control). \nAn NPC's loyalty score increases by ld4 if other party \nembers help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. \n:... - ·ewise, an NPC's loyalty score increases by ld4 if \n-· e PC is treated particularly well (for example, given \na magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party \nmember. An NPC's loyalty score can never be raised \nabove its maximum. \nWhen other party members act in a manner that \n;-uns counter to the NPC's alignment or bond, reduce \n-he PC's loyalty score by ld4. Reduce the NPC's \nnyalty score by 2d4 if the character is abused, misled, \nr endangered by other party members for purely \n: !fish reasons. \nAn NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer \nloyal to the party and might part ways with them. A \nloyalty score can never drop below 0. \nAn NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life \nand limb to help fellow party members. If the NPC's \nloyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous. \nAn NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts in the \nparty's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the \nparty (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or \nworks in secret to bring about the party's downfall. \nCONTACTS \nContacts are NPCs with close ties to one or more of \nthe player characters. They don't go on adventures, \nbut they can provide information, rumors, supplies, or \nprofessional advice, either for free or at a cost.

At the very least, give some \nthought to a contact\'s goals and how those goals are \nlikely to come into play. \nPATRONS \nA patron is a contact who employs the adventurers, \nproviding help or rewards as well as quests and \nadventure hooks. Most of the time, a patron has a vested \ninterest in the adventurers\' success and doesn\'t need to \nbe persuaded to help them. \nA patron might be a retired adventurer who seeks \nyounger heroes to deal with rising threats, or a mayor \nwho knows that the town guard can\'t handle a dragon \ndemanding tribute. A sheriff becomes a patron by \noffering a bounty for kobold raiders terrorizing the local \ncountryside, as does a noble who wants an abandoned \nestate cleared of monsters. \nHIRELINGS \nAdventurers can pay NPCs to provide services \nin a variety of circumstances. Information on \nhirelings appears in chapter 5, "Equipment," of the \nPlayer\'s Handbook. \nHireling NPCs rarely become important in an \nadventure, and most require little development. When \nadventurers hire a coach to carry them across town \nor need a letter delivered, the driver or messenger \nis a hireling, and the adventurers might never even \nconverse with that NPC or learn his or her name. A \nship captain carrying the adventurers across the sea is \nalso a hireling, but such a character has the potential \nto turn into an ally, a patron, or even an enemy as the \nadventure unfolds. \nWhen the adventurers hire an NPC for long-term \nwork, add the cost of that NPC\'s services to the \ncharacters\' lifestyle expenses. See the "Additional \nExpenses" section of chapter 6, "Between Adventures," \nfor more information. \nExTRAS \nExtras are the characters and creatures in the \nbackground that the main characters rarely, if ever, \ninteract with. \nExtras might be elevated to more important roles by \nvirtue of adventurers singling them out. For instance, a \nplayer might be hooked by a passing reference you make \nto a street urchin and try to strike up a conversation \nwith the youngster. Suddenly, an extra on whom you \nplaced no importance becomes a central figure in an \nimprovised roleplaying scene. \nWhenever extras are present, be prepared to come up \nwith names and mannerisms on the fly.

Whatever light burned in the paladin\'s heart \nbeen extinguished. Only darkness remains. \nA paladin must be evil and at least 3rd level to \n~come an Oathbreaker. The paladin replaces the \n:earures specific to his or her Sacred Oath with \nathbreaker features. \n0 ATHBREAKER SPELLS \n_-..n Oathbreaker paladin loses previously gained oath \nspells and instead gains the following Oathbreaker \nspells at the paladin levels listed. \n0ATHBREAKER SPELLS \nPaladin Level \n3rd \n5th \n9th \n13th \n17th \nSpells \nhellish rebuke, inflict wounds \ncrown of madness, darkness \nanimate dead, bestow curse \nblight, confusion \ncontagion, dominate person \nC HANNEL DIVINITY \nAn Oathbreaker paladin of 3rd level or higher gains the \n:ollowing two Channel Divinity options. \nControl Undead. As an action, the paladin targets one \nndead creature he or she can see within 30 feet of him \nor her. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. \nOn a failed save, the target must obey the paladin\'s \ncommands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin \nuses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead \nwhose challenge rating is equal to or greater than the \npaladin\'s level is immune to this effect. \nDreadful Aspect. As an action, the paladin channels \nthe darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of \nmagical menace. Each creature of the paladin\'s choice \nwithin 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom \nsaving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, \nthe target is frightened of the paladin for 1 minute. If a \ncreature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than \n30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another \nWisdom saving throw to end the effect on it. \nAURA OF HATE \nStarting at 7th level, the paladin, as well any fiends and \nundead within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus \nto melee weapon damage rolls equal to the paladin\'s \nCharisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can \nbenefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time. \nf\\t 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \nSUPERNATURAL RESISTANCE \nAt 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to \nbludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from \nnonmagical weapons. \nDREAD LORD \nAt 20th-level, the paladin can, as an action, surround \nhimself or herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 \nminute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot \nradius around the paladin to dim light. Whenever an \nenemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its turn \nin the aura, it takes 4dl0 psychic damage. Additionally, \nthe paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura \nare draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on \nsight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures \ndraped in this shadow. \nWhile the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus \naction on his or her turn to cause the shadows in the \naura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a \nmelee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, \nthe target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 +.the \npaladin\'s Charisma modifier. \nAfter activating the aura, the paladin can\'t do so again \nuntil he or she finishes a long rest. \n0ATHBREAKER ATONEMENT \nIf you allow a player to choose the Oath breaker option, \nyou can later allow the paladin to atone and become a true \npaladin once more. \nThe paladin who wishes to atone must first shed his or \nher evil alignment and demonstrate this alignment change \nthrough words and deeds. Having done so, the paladin \nloses all Oath breaker features and must choose a deity \nand a sacred oath. (With your permission, the player can \nselect a different deity or sacred oath than the character \nhad previously.) However, the paladin doesn\'t gain the \nclass featu res specific to that sacred oath until he or \nshe completes some kind of dangerous quest or trial, as \ndetermined by the DM . \nA paladin who breaks his or her sacred oath a second time \ncan become an oath breaker once more, but can\'t atone. \nCHAPTER 4 I CREATING NON PLAYER CHARACTERS \n97 \n'},

A \n:ilderness trek across the Desert of Desolation or a \narrowing journey into the jungles of the Isle of Dread \ncan be an exciting adventure in its own right. In the \ngreat outdoors, dragons wheel across the sky in search \nf prey, tribes of hobgoblins pour forth from their grim \n·ortresses to wage war against their neighbors, ogres \nplunder farmsteads for food, and monstrous spiders \nop from the web-shrouded canopies of trees. \nWithin a dungeon, adventurers are constrained by \n:ails and doors around them, but in the wilderness, \nadventurers can travel in almost any direction they \nplease. Therein lies the key difference between dungeon \nand wilderness: it's much easier to predict where the \nadventuring party might go in the dungeon because the \nptions are limited- less so in the wilderness. \nillages, towns, and cities are cradles of civilization \nn a dangerous world, but they too offer opportunities \n· r adventure.

A lair is a place where monsters live. Typical \nairs include ruins and caves. \nMaze. A maze is intended to deceive oi- confuse \nthose who enter it. Some mazes are elaborate obstacles \nthat protect treasure, while others are gauntlets for \nprisoners banished there to be hunted and devoured by \nthe monsters within. \nMine. An abandoned mine can quickly become \ninfested with monsters, while miners who delve too \ndeep can break through into the Underdark. \nPlanar Gate. Dungeons built around planar portals \nare often transformed by the planar energy seeping out \nthrough those portals. \nStronghold. A stronghold dungeon provides a secure \nbase of operations for villains and monsters. It is \nually ruled by a powerful individual, such as a wizard, \n·:ampire, or dragon, and it is larger and more complex \nilian a simple lair. \nTemple or Shrine. This dungeon is consecrated to \na deity or other planar entity. The entity's worshipers \ncontrol the dungeon and conduct their rites there. \nTomb. Tombs are magnets for treasure hunters, as \nwell as monsters that hunger for the bones of the dead. \nTreasure Vault. Built to protect powerful magic items \nand great material wealth, treasure vault dungeons are \n: eavily guarded by monsters and traps. \nHISTORY \nn most cases, the original architects of a dungeon are \nong gone, and the question of what happened to them \ncan help shape the dungeon's current state. \nThe Dungeon History table notes key events that \ncan transform a site from its original purpose into a \ndungeon for adventurers to explore. Particularly old \ndungeons can have a history that consists of multiple \nevents, each of which transformed the site in some way. \nDUNGEON HISTORY \nd20 \nKey Event \n1- 3 \n4 \n5-8 \n9-10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14-15 \n16 \nAbandoned by creators \nAbandoned due to plague \nConquered by invaders \nCreators destroyed by attacking raiders \nCreators destroyed by discovery made within the \nsite \nCreators destroyed by internal conflict \nCreators destroyed by magical catastrophe \nCreators destroyed by natural disaster \nLocation cursed by the gods and shunned \n17,-18 \nOriginal creator still in control \n19 \nOverrun by planar creatures \n20 \nSite of a great miracle \nDUNGEON INHABITANTS \nAfter a dungeon's creators depart, anyone or anything \nmight move in. Intelligent monsters, mindless dungeon \nscavengers, predators and prey alike can be drawn \nto dungeons. \nThe monsters in a dungeon are more than a \ncollection of random creatures that happen to live \nnear one another. Fungi, vermin, scavengers, and \npredators can coexist in a complex ecology, alongside \nintelligent creatures who share living space through \nelaborate combinations of domination, negotiation, and \nbloodshed. \nCharacters might be able to sneak into a dungeon, \nally with one faction, or play factions against each other \nto reduce the threat of the more powerful monsters. \nFor example, in a dungeon inhabited by mind !layers \nand their goblinoid thralls, the adventurers might try \nto incite the goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears to revolt \nagainst their illithid masters. \nDUNGEON FACTIONS \nA dungeon is sometimes dominated by a single group \nof intelligent humanoids, whether a tribe of orcs \nthat have taken over a cavern complex or a gang of \ntrolls inhabiting an aboveground ruin. Other times, \nparticularly in larger dungeons, multiple groups of \ncreatures share space and compete for resources. \nFor example, orcs that dwell in the mines of a ruined \ndwarf citadel might skirmish constantly against the \nhobgoblins that hold the citadel's upper tiers. Mind \n!layers that have established a colony in the lowest \nlevels of the mines could manipulate and dominate key \nhobgoblins in an attempt to wipe out the orcs. And all \nthe while, a hidden cell of drow scouts watches and \nplots to slay the mind !layers, then enslave whatever \ncreatures are left. \nIt's easy to think of a dungeon as a collection of \nencounters, with the adventurers kicking down door \nCHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVTRONMENTS \n101 \n"},

Dungeon denizens are used to striking \nunlikely alliances, and adventurers are a wild card that \ncanny monsters seek to exploit. \nIntelligent creatures in a dungeon have goals, whether \nas simple as short-term survival or as ambitious \nas claiming the entire dungeon as the first step in \nfounding an empire. Such creatures might approach \nadventurers with an offer of alliance, hoping to prevent \nthe characters from laying waste to their lair and to \nsecure aid against their enemies. Bring the NPC leaders \nof such groups to life as described in chapter 4, fleshing \nout their personalities, goals, and ideals. Then use \nthose elements to shape a response to the arrival of \nadventurers in their territory. \nDUNGEON ECOLOGY \nAn inhabited dungeon has its own ecosystem. The \ncreatures that live there need to eat, drink, breathe, and \nsleep, just as creatures in the wilderness do. Predators \nneed to be able to seek prey, and intelligent creatures \nsearch for lairs offering the best combination of air, \nfood, water, and security. Keep these factors in mind \nwhen designing a dungeon you want the players to \nbelieve in. If a dungeon doesn't have some internal logic \nto it, adventurers will find it difficult to make reasonable \ndecisions within that environment. \nFor example, characters who find a pool of fresh water \nin a dungeon might make the logical assumption that \nmany of the creatures inhabiting the dungeon come to \nthat spot to drink. The adventurers might set an ambush \nat the pool. Likewise, locked doors- or even doors that \nrequire hands to open-can restrict the movement of \nsome creatures. If all the doors in a dungeon are closed, \nthe players might wonder how the carrion crawlers or \nstirges they repeatedly encounter manage to survive. \nENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY \nYou might be inclined to increase the encounter \ndifficulty as the adventurers descend deeper into the \ndungeon, as a way to keep the dungeon challenging as \nthe characters gain levels or to ratchet up the tension. \nHowever, this approach can turn the dungeon into a \ngrind. A better approach is to include encountets of \nvarying difficulty throughout. The contrast between easy \nand hard encounters, as well as simple and complex \nencounters, encourages characters to vary their tactics \nand keeps the encounters from seeming too similar. \nMAPPING A DUNGEON \nEvery dungeon needs a map showing its layout. \nThe dungeon's location, creator, purpose, history, \nand inhabitants should give you a starting point for \ndesigning your dungeon map. If you need further \ninspiration, you can find maps that have been made \nfreely available for use on the Internet, or even use a \nmap of a real-world location. Alternatively, you can \nborrow a map from a published adventure or randomly \ngenerate a dungeon complex using the tables presented \nin appendix A. \nCHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVlRONMENTS \nA dungeon can range in size from a few chambers \nin a ruined temple to a huge complex of rooms and \npassages extending hundreds of feet in all directions. \nThe adventurers' goal often lies as far from the dungeon \nentrance as possible, forcing characters to delve \ndeeper underground or push farther into the heart of \nthe complex. \nA dungeon is most easily mapped on graph paper, \nwith each square on the paper representing an area of \n10 feet by 10 feet. (If you play with miniatures on a grid, \nyou might prefer a scale where each square represents 5 \nfeet, or you can subdivide your 10-foot grid into a 5-foot \ngrid when you draw your maps for combat.) When you \ndraw your map, keep the following points in mind: \nAsymmetrical rooms and map layouts make a \ndungeon less predictable. \nThink in three dimensions. Stairs, ramps, platforms, \nledges, balconies, pits, and other changes of elevation \nmake a dungeon more interesting and make combat \nencounters in those areas more challenging. \n• Give the dungeon some wear and tear. Unless you \nwant to stress that the dungeon's builders were \nextraordinarily skillful, collapsed passages can be \ncommonplace, cutting off formerly connected sections \nof the dungeon from each other. Past earthquakes \nmight have opened chasms within a dungeon, splitting \nrooms and corridors to make interesting obstacles. \nIncorporate natural features into even a constructed \ndungeon. An underground stream might run through \nthe middle of a dwarven stronghold, causing variation \nin the shapes and sizes of rooms and necessitating \nfeatures such as bridges and drains. \n• Add multiple entrances and exits. Nothing gives the \nplayers a stronger sense of making real decisions than \nhaving multiple ways to enter a dungeon. \nAdd secret doors and secret rooms to reward players \nwho take.the time to search for them. \nIf you need help creating a dungeon map from scratch, \nsee appendix A. \nDUNGEON FEATURES \nThe atmosphere and physical characteristics of \ndungeons vary as widely as their origins. An old crypt \nmight have stone walls and loose wooden doors, an odor \nof decay, and no light other than what adventurers bring \nwith them. A volcanic lair might have smooth stone \nwalls hollowed out by past eruptions, doors of magically \nreinforced brass, a smell of sulfur, and light provided by \njets of flame in every hall and room. \nWALLS \nSome dungeons have walls of masonry. Others have \nwalls of solid rock, hewn with tools to give them a \nrough, chiseled look, or worn smooth by the passage of \nwater or lava. An aboveground dungeon might be made \nof wood or composite materials. \nWalls are sometimes adorned with murals, frescoes, \nbas-reliefs, and lighting fixtures such as sconces or \ntorch brackets. A few even have secret doors built \ninto them. \n"},

They might be festooned with carvings of \ngargoyles or leering faces or engraved with sigils that \nreveal clues as to what lies beyond. \nStuck Doors. Dungeon doors often become stuck \nwhen not used frequently. Opening a stuck door requires \na successful Strength check. Chapter 8, "Running the \nGame," provides guidelines for setting the DC. \nLocked Doors. Characters who don\'t have the key \nro a locked door can pick the lock with a successful \nDexterity check (doing so requires thieves\' tools and \nproficiency in their use). They can also force the door \nwith a successful Strength check, smash the door to \npieces by dealing enough damage to it, or use a knock \nspell or similar magic. Chapter 8 provides guidelines \n• \nfor setting the DCs and assigning statistics to doors and \nother objects. \nBarred Doors. A barred door is similar to a locked \ndoor, except that there\'s no lock to pick, and the door \ncan be opened normally from the barred side by using \nan action to lift the bar from its braces. \nSECRET DOORS \nA secret door is crafted to blend into the wall that \nsurrounds it.

Once a secret door is \ndetected, a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check \nmight be required to determine how to open it if the \nopening mechanism isn't obvious. Set the DC according \nto the difficulty guidelines in chapter 8. \nIf adventurers can't determine how to open a secret \ndoor, breaking it down is always an option. Treat it \nas a locked door made of the same material as the \nsurrounding wall, and use the guidelines in chapter 8 to \ndetermine appropriate DCs or statistics. \nCoNCEALED DooRs \nA concealed door is a normal door that is hidden from \nview. A secret door is carefully crafted to blend into its \nsurrounding surface, whereas a concealed door is most \noften hidden by mundane means. It might be covered \nby a tapestry, covered with plaster, or (in the case of \na concealed trapdoor) hidden under a rug. Normally, \nno ability check is required to find a concealed door. A \ncharacter need only look in the right place or take the \nright steps to reveal the door. However, you can use \nthe characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to \nCHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVTRONMENTS \ndetermin·e whether any of them notices tracks or signs \nof a tapestry or rug having been recently disturbed. \nPORTCULLISES \nA portcullis is a set of vertical bars made of wood or \niron, reinforced with one or more horizontal bands. It \nblocks a passage or archway until it is raised up into \nthe ceiling by a winch and chain. The main benefit of a \nportcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing \nguards to watch the area beyond and make ranged \nattacks or cast spells through it. \nWinching a portcullis up or down requires an action. \nIf a character can't reach the winch (usually because it is \non the other side of the portcullis), lifting the portcullis \nor bending its bars far enough apart to pass through \nthem requires a successful Strength check. The DC \nof the check depends on the size and weight of the \nportcullis or the thickness of its bars.

A patch of brown mold typically \ncovers a 10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 \nfeet of it is always frigid. \nWhen a creature moves to within 5 feet of the mold \nfor the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it \nmust make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking \n22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much \ndamage on a successful one. \nBrown mold is immune to fire, and any source of fire \nbrought within 5 feet of a patch causes it to instantly \nexpand outward in the direction of the fire, covering a \n10-foot-square area (with the source of the fire at the \ncenter of that area). A patch of brown mold exposed to \nan effect that deals cold damage is instantly destroyed. \nGREEN SLIME \nThis acidic slime devours flesh, organic material, and \nmetal on contact. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings \nto walls, floors, and ceilings in patches. \nA patch of green slime covers a 5-foot square, has \nblindsight out to a range of 30 feet, and drops from \nwalls and ceilings when it detects movement below it. \nBeyond that, it has no ability to move. A creature aware \nof the slime\'s presence can avoid being struck by it with \na successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, \nthe slime can\'t be avoided as it drops. \nA creature that comes into contact with green slime \ntakes 5 (1d10) acid damage. The creature takes the \ndamage again at the start of each of its turns until the \nslime is scraped off or destroyed. Against wood or \nmetal, green slime deals 11 (2d10) acid damage each \nround, and any nonmagical wood or metal weapon or \ntool used to scrape off the slime is effectively destroyed. \nSunlight, any effect that cures disease, and any effect \nthat deals cold, fire, or radiant damage destroys a patch \nof green slime. \nWEBS \nGiant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages \nand at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled \nareas are difficult terrain. Moreover, a creature entering \na webbed area for the first time on a turn or starting its \nturn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving \nthrow or become restrained by the webs. A restrained \ncreature can use its action to try to escape, doing \nso with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or \nDexterity (Acrobatics) check. \nEach 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC 10, 15 \nhit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to \nbludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage. \nYELLOW MOLD \nYellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers \na 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of \nspores that fills a 10-foot cube originating from the \nmold. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC \n15 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison \ndamage and become poisoned for 1 minute. While \npoisoned in this way, the creature takes 5 (1d10) poison \ndamage at the start of each of its turns. The creature \ncan repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its \nturns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. \nSunlight or any amount of fire damage instantly \ndestroys one patch of yellow mold. \nCHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS \n105 \n'},

  'text': 'ro6 r \nWILDERNESS \nBetween the dungeons and settlements of your \ncampaign world lie meadows, forests, deserts, mountain \nranges, oceans, and other tracts of wilderness waiting \nto be traversed. Bringing wilderness areas to life can be \na fun part of your game, both for you and your players. \nThe following two approaches work particularly well. \nTRAVEL- MONTAGE APPROACH \nSometimes the destination is more important than the \njourney. If the purpose of a wilderness trek is to get \nthe characters to where the real adventure happens, \ngloss over the wilderness trek without checking for \nencounters along the way. Just as movies use travel \nmontages to convey long and arduous journeys in a \nmatter of seconds, you can use a few sentences of \ndescriptive text to paint a picture of a wilderness trek in \nyour players\' minds before moving on. \nDescribe the journey as vividly as you like, but keep \nthe forward momentum. "You walk for several miles \nand encounter nothing of interest" is okay, but far less \nevocative and memorable than, "A light rain dampens \nthe rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, \nyou break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue \nfinds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but \notherwise you encounter nothing out of the ordinary." \nThe trick is to focus on a few details that reinforce the \ndesired mood rather than describe everything down to \nthe last blade of grass. \nCall attention to unusual terrain features: a waterfall, \na rocky outcropping that offers a breathtaking view over \nthe tops of the surrounding trees, an area where the \nforest has burned or been cut down, and so on. Also \ndescribe notable smells and sounds, such as the roar of \na faraway monster, the stench of burned wood, or the \nsweet aroma of flowers in an elven forest. \nIn addition to evocative language, visual aids can help \nset the scene for the characters\' travels. Image searches \non the Internet can lead you to breathtaking landscapes \n(in fact, that\'s a good phrase to search for) both real and \nfantastical. As striking as real-world scenery can be, \nwilderness travel can be used to remind the players that \ntheir characters are in a fantasy world. Once in a while, \nspice up your descriptions with some truly magical \nelement. A forest might be home to tiny dragonets \ninstead of birds, or its trees might be festooned with \ngiant webs or have eerie, green-glowing sap. Use these \nelements sparingly; landscapes that are too alien can \nbreak your players\' sense of immersion in the world. A \nsingle fantastic element within an otherwise realistic \nand memorable landscape is enough. \nUse the landscape to set the mood and tone for your \nadventure. In one forest, close-set trees shroud all \nlight and seem to watch the adventurers as they pass. \nIn another, sunlight streams through the leaves above \nand flower-laden vines twine up every trunk. Signs \nof corruption-rotting wood, foul-smelling water, and \nrocks covered with slimy brown moss- can be a signal \nthat the adventurers are drawing close to the site of evil \npower that is their destination or can provide clues to \nthe nature of the threats to be found there. \nCHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS \nSpecific wilderness locations might have their own \nspecial features. For example, the Spirit Forest and \nthe Spiderhaunt Woods might feature different kinds \nof trees, different kinds of flora and fauna, different \nweather. and different random encounter tables. \nFinally, a wilderness trek can be enhanced by calling \nattention to the weather. "You spend the next three \ndays crossing the swamp" sounds less harrowing than, \n"You spend the next three days trudging through knee-\ndeep mud- the first two days and nights in the pouring \nrain, and then another day under the beating sun, with \nswarms of hungry insects feasting on your blood." \nHouR-BY-HouR APPROACH \nSometimes the journey deserves as much time and \nattention as the destination. If wilderness travel feature \nprominently in your adventure and isn\'t something you \nwant to gloss over, you will need more than a descriptive \noverview to bring a long and harrowing journey to life; \nyou\'ll need to know the party\'s marching order and have \nencounters at the ready. \nLet your players determine the party\'s marching \norder (see the Player\'s Handbook for more information). \nCharacters in the front rank are likely to be the first to \nnotice landmarks and terrain features, as well as the \nones responsible for navigating. Characters in the back \nrank are usually responsible for making sure that the \nparty isn\'t being followed. Encourage characters in the \nmiddle ranks to do something other than blindly trudge \nalong behind the front-rank characters. The Player\'s \nHandbook suggests activities such as mapmaking and \nforaging for food. \nWilderness journeys typically feature a combination of \nplanned encounters (encounters that you prepare ahead \nof time) and random encounters (encounters determined \nby rolling on a table). A planned encounter might need a \nm~p of the location where the encounter is set to occur, \nsuch as a ruin, a bridge spanning a gorge, or some other \nmemorable location. Random encounters tend to be \nless location-specific. The fewer planned encounters \nyou have, the more you\'ll need to rely on random \nencounters to keep the journey interesting. See chapter \n3 for guidelines on creating your own random encounter \ntables and when to check for random encounters. \nA good way to keep wilderness encounters from \nbecoming stale is to make sure they don\'t all start and \nend the same way. In other words, if the wilderness \nis your stage and your adventure is the play or movie, \nthink of each wilderness encounter as its own scene, \nand try to stage each one in a slightly different way to \nkeep your players\' interest. If one encounter comes \nat the adventurers from the front, the next one might \ncome at them from above or behind. If an encounter \nfeatures stealthy monsters, a character tending to the \nparty\'s pack animals might get the first indication that \nmonsters are near when a pony whickers nervously. If \nan encounter features loud monsters, the party might \nhave the option to hide or set an ambush. One group of \nmonsters might attack the party on sight, and another \nmight allow safe passage for food. \nReward characters for searching while they travel by \nproviding things for them to find. Broken statues, tracks, \n'},

  'text': "abandoned campsites, and other finds can add flavor to \nyour world, foreshadow future encounters or events, or \nprovide hooks for further adventures. \nA wilderness journey might take multiple sessions to \nplay out. That said, if the wilderness journey includes \nlong periods with no encounters, use the travel-montage \napproach to bridge gaps between encounters. \nMAPPING A WILDERNESS \nIn contrast to a dungeon, an outdoor setting presents \nseemingly limitless options. The adventurers can move \nin any direction over a trackless desert or an open \ngrassland, so how do you as the DM deal with all the \npossible locations and events that might make up a \nwilderness campaign? What if you design an encounter \nin a desert oasis, but the characters miss the oasis \nbecause they wander off course? How do you avoid \ncreating a boring play session of uninterrupted slogging \nacross a rocky wasteland? \nOne solution is to think of an outdoor setting in the \nsame way you think about a dungeon. Even the most \nwide-open terrain presents clear pathways. Roads \nseldom run straight because they follow the contours \nof the land, finding the most level or otherwise easiest \nroutes across uneven ground. Valleys and ridges \nchannel travel in certain directions. Mountain ranges \npresent forbidding barriers traversed only by remote \npasses. Even the most trackless desert reveals favored \nroutes, where explorers and caravan drivers have \ndiscovered areas of wind-blasted rock that are easier to \ntraverse than shifting sand. \nIf the party veers off track, you might be able to \nrelocate one or more of your planned encounters \nelsewhere on the map to ensure that the time spent \npreparing those encounters doesn't go to waste. \nChapter 1 discusses the basics of creating a \nwilderness map at three different scales to help \nyou design your world and the starting area of your \ncampaign. Especially when you get down to province \nscale (1 hex= 1 mile), think about paths of travel- roads, \npasses, ridges and valleys, and so on-that can guide \ncharacter movement across your map. \nMOVEMENT ON THE MAP \nNarrate wilderness travel at a level of detail appropriate \nto the map you're using. If you're tracking hour-by-hour \nmovement on a province-scale map (1 hex= 1 mile), \nyou can describe each hamlet the adventurers pass. \nAt this scale, you can assume that the characters find \na noteworthy location when they enter its hex unl~ ss \nthe site is specifically hidden. The characters might not \nwalk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle when \nthey enter a hex, but they can find old paths, outlying \nruins, and other signs of its presence in the area. \nIf you're tracking a journey of several days on a \nkingdom-scale map (1 hex= 6 miles), don't bother with \ndetails too small to appear on your map. It's enough \nfor the players to know that on the third day of their \njourney, they cross a river and the land starts rising \nbefore them, and that they reach the mountain pass two \ndays later. \nCHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS \nWILDERNESS FEATURES \no wilderness map is complete without a few \nsettlements, strongholds, ruins, and other sites worthy \nof discovery. A dozen such locations scattered over an \narea roughly 50 miles across is a good start. \nMo STER LAIRS \nA wilderness area approximately 50 miles across can \nsupport roughly a half-dozen monster lairs, but probably \nno more than one apex predator such as a dragon. \nIf you expect the characters to explore a monster's \nlair, you'll need to find or create an appropriate map for \nthe lair and stock the lair as you would a dungeon. \nMONUMENTS \nIn places where civilization rules or once ruled, \nadventurers might find monuments built to honor great \nleaders, gods, and cultures. Use the Monuments table \nfor inspiration, or randomly roll to determine what \nmonument the adventurers stumble upon. \nMONUMENTS \nd20 \nMonument \nl \nSealed burial mound or pyramid \n2 \nPlundered burial mound or pyramid \n3 \nFaces carved into a mountainside or cliff \n4 \nGiant statues carved out of a mountainside or cliff \nS-6 \nIntact obelisk etched with a warning, historical \nlore, dedication, or religious iconography \n7-8 \nRuined or toppled obelisk \n9-10 \nIntact statue of a person or deity \n11-13 \nRuined or toppled statue of a person or deity \n14 \nGreat stone wall, intact, with tower fortifications \nspaced at one-mile intervals \n15 \nGreat stone wall in ruins \n16 \nGreat stone arch \n17 \nFountain \n18 \nIntact circle of standing stones \n19 \nRuined or toppled circle of standing stones \n20 \nTotem pole \nRUINS \nCrumbling towers, ancient temples, and razed cities \nare perfect sites for adventures. Additionally, noting the \nexistence of an old, crumbling wall that runs alongside a \nroad, a sagging stone windmill on a hilltop, or a jumble \nof standing stones can add texture to your wilderness. \nSETTLEMENTS \nSettlements exist in places where food, water, farmland, \nand building materials are abundant. A civilized \nprovince roughly 50 miles across might have one city, a \nfew rural towns, and a scattering of villages and trading \nposts. An uncivilized area might have a single trading \npost that stands at the edge of a wild frontier, but no \nlarger settlements. \nIn addition to settlements, a province might contain \nruined villages and towns that are either abandoned or \nserve as lairs for marauding bandits and monsters. \n"},

Creatures with \nresistance or immunity to cold damage automatically \nsucceed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing \ncold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and \ncreatures naturally adapted to cold climates. \nEXTREME HEAT \nWhen the temperature is at or above 100 degrees \nFahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and \nwithout access to drinkable water must succeed on \na Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour \nor gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the \nfirst hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. \nCreatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are \nclad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving \nthrow. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire \ndamage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as \ndo creatures naturally adapted to hot climates. \nSTRONG WIND \nA strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon \nattack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on \nhearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, \ndisperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means \nnearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind \nmust land at the end of its turn or fall. \nA strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that \nimposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks \nthat rely on sight. \nHEAVY PRECIPITATION \nEverything within an area of heavy rain or heavy \nsnowfall is lightly obscured, and creatures in the area \nhave disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that \nrely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames \nand imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) \nchecks that rely on hearing. \nHIGH ALTITUDE \n--------------~------------------\nTraveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above \nsea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, \nbecause of the reduced amount of oxygen in the \nair. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at \nhigh altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of \ndetermining how long that creature can travel. \nBreathing creatures can become acclimated to a high \naltitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. \nBreathing creatures can't become acclimated to \nelevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to \nsuch environments. \nWILDERNESS HAZARDS \nThis section describes a few examples of hazards that \nadventurers might encounter in the wilderness. \nSome hazards, such as slippery ice and razorvine, \nrequire no ability check to spot. Others, such as \ndefiled ground, are undetectable by normal senses. \nCHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVJRONMENTS \nThe other hazards presented here can be identified \nwith a successful Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the \nguidelines in chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any \ncheck made to spot or recognize a hazard. \nDESECRATED GROUND \nSome cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the \nunseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated \nground can be any size, and a detect evil and good spell \ncast within range reveals its presence. \nUndead standing on desecrated ground have \nadvantage on all saving throws. \nA vial of holy water purifies a 10-foot-square area of \ndesecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a hallow \nspell purifies desecrated ground within its area. \nFRIGID WATER \nA creature can be immersed in frigid water for a \nnumber of minutes equal to its Constitution score before \nsuffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent \nin frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a \nDC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of \nexhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to \ncold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw. \nas do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in \nice-cold water. \nQUICKSAND \nA quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a 10-foot-\nsquare area and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature \nenters the area, it sinks ld4 + 1 feet into the quicksand \nand becomes restrained. At the start of each of the \ncreature's turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as \nthe creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand, \nit can escape by using its action and succeeding on a \nStrength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet \nthe creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature \nthat is completely submerged in quicksand can't breathe \n(see the suffocation rules in the Player's Handbook). \nA creature can pull another creature within its reach \nout of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding \non a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of \nfeet the target creature has sunk into the quicksand. \nRAZORVINE \nRazorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and \nhedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and \nother surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide, \n5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC 11, 25 \nhit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and \npsychic damage. \nWhen a creature comes into direct contact with \nrazorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature \nmust succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or \ntake 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the razorvine's \nbladelike thorns. \nSLIPPERY IcE \nSlippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves \nonto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must \nsucceed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or \nfall prone. \n"},

Note the location of \nthe village center. If the adventurers visit specific places \nin the village, mark those spots on your map. \nFor towns and cities, note major roads and waterways \nas well as surrounding terrain. Outline the walls \nand mark the locations of features you know will be \nimportant: the lord's keep, significant temples, and \nthe like. For cities, add internal walls and think about \nthe personality of each ward. Give the wards names \nreflecting their personalities, which also identify \nthe kinds of trades that dominate the neighborhood \n(Tannery Square, Temple Row), a geographical \ncharacteristic (Hilltop, Riverside), or a dominant site \n(the Lords' Quarter). \nURBAN ENCOUNTERS \nAlthough they hold the promise of safety, cities and \ntowns can be just as dangerous as the darkest dungeon. \nEvil hides in plain sight or in dark corners. Sewers, \nshadowy alleys, slums, smoke-filled taverns, dilapidated \ntenements, and crowded marketplaces can quickly turn \ninto battlegrounds. On top of that, adventurers must \nlearn to behave themselves, lest they attract unwanted \nattention from local authorities. \n· \nThat said, characters who don't go looking for trouble \ncan take advantage of all the benefits that a settlement \nhas to offer. \nLAW AND ORDER \nWhether a settlement has a police force depends on its \nsize and nature. A lawful, orderly city might have a city \nwatch to maintain order and a trained militia to defend \nits walls, and a frontier town might rely on adventurers \nor its citizenry to apprehend criminals and fend off \nattackers. \nTRIALS \nIn most settlements, trials are overseen by magistrates \nor local lords. Some trials are argued, with the \nconflicting parties or their advocates presenting \nCHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS \nprecedent and evidence until the judge makes \na decision. with or without the aid of spells or \ninterrogation. Others are decided with a trial by ordeal \nor trial by combat. If the evidence against the accused \nis overwhelming, a magistrate or local lord can forgo a \ntrial and skip right to the sentencing. \nSENTENCES \nA settlement might have a jail to hold accused criminals \nawaiting trial, but few settlements have prisons to \nincarcerate convicted criminals. A person found guilty \nof a crime is usually fined, condemned to forced labor \nfor a period of several months or years, exiled, or \nexecuted, depending on the magnitude of the crime. \nRANDOM URBAN ENCOUNTERS \nThe Random Urban Encounters table is useful for \ncity- and town-based adventures. Check for a random \nencounter at least once per day, and once at night if \nthe characters are out and about. Reroll the result if it \ndoesn't make sense given the time of day. \nRANDOM URBAN ENCOUNTERS \ndl2 + d8 \nEncounter \n2 \nAnimals on the loose \n3 \nAnnouncement \n4 \nBrawl \n5 \nBullies \n6 \nCompanion \n7 \nContest \n8 \nCor-pse \n9 \nDraft \n10 \nDrunk \n11 \nFire \n12 \nFound trinket \n13 \nGuard harassment \n14 \nPickpocket \n15 \nProcession \n16 \nProtest \n17 \nRunaway cart \n18 \nShady transaction \n19 \nSpectacle \n20 \nUrchin \nAnimals on the Loose.

There aren't rules for determining when a shipwreck \nhappens; it happens when you want or need it to happen. \nEven the strongest seafaring ship can founder in a storm, \nrun aground on rocks or reefs, sink during a pirate attack, or \nbe dragged underwater by a sea monster.

Rain and \n-og reduce visibility just as they do on land. \nOWNING A SHIP \nAt some point in your campaign, the adventurers \nmight gain custody of a ship. They might purchase or \ncapture one or receive one to carry out a mission. It\'s \nup to you whether a ship is available for purchase, and \nyou have the power to deprive the adventurers of a \nhip at any time should it become a nuisance (see the \n-Shipwrecks" sidebar). \nCrew. A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to \n"unction. As per the Player\'s Handbook, one skilled \nhireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum \nnumber of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship \ndepends on the type of vessel, as shown in the Airborne \nand Waterborne Vehicles table. \nYou can track the loyalty of individual crew members \nor the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules \nin chapter 4.

If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew members \nleave the ship and never return. \nPassengers. The table indicates the number of Small \nand Medium passengers the ship can accommodate. \nAccommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight \nquarters.

One wrong step \nin an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything \nblades, which cleave through armor and bone. The \nseemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave \nentrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes \nthrough them. A net hidden among the trees might drop \non travelers who pass underneath.

Mechanical traps include pits, arrow \ntraps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling \nblades, and anything else that depends on \na mechanism to operate. Magic traps are either \nmagical device traps or spell traps. Magical device \ntraps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps \nare spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that \nfunction as traps. \nCHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS \nSIN PLAY \nWhen adventurers come across a trap, you need to know \nhow the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the \npossibility for the characters to detect the trap and to \ndisable or avoid it. \nTRIGGERING A TRAP \nMost traps are triggered when a creature goes \nsomewhere or touches something that the trap's creator \nwanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on \na pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip \nwire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a \nlock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature \nenters an area or touches an object. Some magic \ntraps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more \ncomplicated trigger conditions, including a password \nthat prevents the trap from activating. \nDETECTING AND DISABLING A TRAP \nUsually, some element of a trap is visible to careful \ninspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone \nthat conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off \na trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which \njets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something \nthat points to a trap's presence. \nA trap's description specifies the checks and DCs \nneeded to detect it, disable it, or both.

  'text': "actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom \n(Perception) check against the trap's DC. You can \nalso compare the DC to detect the trap with each \ncharacter's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to \ndetermine whether anyone in the party notices the \ntrap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before \ntriggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either \npermanently or long enough to move past it. You might \ncall for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a \ncharacter to deduce what needs to be done, followed \nby a Dexterity check using thieves' tools to perform the \nnecessary sabotage. \nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) \ncheck to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to \nany other checks noted in the trap's description. The \nDCs are the same regardless of the check used. In \naddition, dispel magic has a chance of disabling most \nmagic traps. A magic trap's description provides the DC \nfor the ability check made when you use dispel magic. \nIn most cases, a trap's description is clear enough \nthat you can adjudicate whether a character's actions \nlocate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you \nshouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and \ngood planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the \ntrap's description to determine what happens. No trap's \ndesign can anticipate every possible action that the \ncharacters might attempt. \nYou should allow a character to discover a trap \nwithout making an ability check if an action would \nclearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a \ncharacter lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, \nrhe character has found the trigger and no check \nis required. \nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. \nConsider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened \nwithout first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a \nmechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward \nanyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and \nmaking a few checks, the characters are still unsure \nif it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they \nprop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at \na distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still \nrriggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into \nthe shield. \nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow \nthem to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters \nthat place traps in or around their lairs need ways \nro get past those traps without harming themselves. \nuch traps might have hidden levers that disable their \ntriggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that \ngoes around the trap. \nT RAP EFFECTS \nThe effects of traps can range from inconvenient to \ndeadly, making use of elements such as arrows, \n- pikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, \nand deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple \nelements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature \nunfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap's description \nspecifies what happens when it is triggered. \nThe attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its \neffects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on \nthe trap's severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack \nBonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table \nfor suggestions based on three levels of trap severity. \nA trap intended to be a setback is unlikely to kill \nor seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, \nwhereas a dangerous trap is likely to seriously injure \n(and potentially kill) characters of the indicated \nlevels. A deadly trap is likely to kill characters of the \nindicated levels. \nTRAP SAVE DCs AND ATTACK BoNusEs \nTrap Danger \nSave DC \nAttack Bonus \nSetback \n10-11 \n+3 to +5 \nDangerous \n12-15 \n+6 to +8 \nDeadly \n16-20 \n+9 to +12 \nDAMAGE SEVERITY BY LEVEL \nCharacter Level \nSetback \nDangerous \nDeadly \n1st-4th \n1d10~ \n4d10 \n5th-10th \n2d10 \n4d10 \n10d10 \n11th-16th \n4dl'o \n10d10 \n18d10 \n17th-20t \n10d10 \n18d10 \n24d10 \nCOMPLEX TRAPS \nComplex traps work like standard traps, except once \nactivated they execute a series of actions each round. A \ncomplex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap \ninto something more like a combat encounter. \nWhen a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative.

Otherwise, the complex trap can be \ndetected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways. \nFor example, a trap that causes a room to slowly \nflood works best as a complex trap. On the trap\'s turn, \nthe water level rises. After several rounds, the room is \ncompletely flooded. \nSAMPLE TRAPS \nThe magical and mechanical traps presented here vary \nin deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order. \nCOLLAPSING ROOF \nMechanical trap \nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports \nkeeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place. \nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches \nbetween two support beams. The DC to spot the trip \nwire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using \nthieves\' tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A \ncharacter without thieves\' tools can attempt this check \nwith disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged \ntool. On a failed check, the trap triggers. \nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine \nthat they are merely wedged in place. As an action, \na character can knock over a beam, causing the trap \nto trigger. \nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, \nand anyone who can see it can tell that it\'s in danger \nof collapse. \nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling \ncollapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable \nsection must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving \nthrow, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed \nsave, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once \nthe trap is \\riggered, the floor of the area is filled with \nrubble and becomes difficult terrain. \nFALLING ~~T \nMechanical trap \nThis trap uses\\ trip wire to release a net suspended \nfrom the ceiling\\ \n. \nThe trip wire,is\'J~nches off the ground and stretches \nbetween two column~r trees. The net is hidden by \ncobwebs or foliage. The IJC to spot the trip wire and net \nis 10. A successful DC 15 D~~rity check using thieves\' \ntools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character \nwithout thieves\' tools can attem~ this check with \ndisadvantage using any edged wea!\'lon or edged tool. On \na failed check, the trap triggers. \nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, \ncovering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are \ntrapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail \na DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. \nA creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength \ncheck, freeing itself or another creature within its reach \non a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. \nDealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a \n5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped \nin that section. \nCHAPTER 5 \\ ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS \nfiRE - BREATHL"G \n--..,_~ \n~ \nMagic trap \nThis trap is activated when an in-\nde- tep on a \nhidden pressure plate, relea ina a magical gout of flame \nfrom a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, \nincluding a dragon or a wizard casting a spell. \nThe DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as \nfaint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or \nother effect that can sense the presence of magic, such \nas detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic \naround the statue. \nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of \nweight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the \nstatue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature \nin the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, \ntaking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as \nmuch damage on a successful one. \nWedging an iron spike or other object under the \npressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A \nsuccessful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue \ndestroys the trap. \nPITS \nMechanical trap \nFour basic pit traps are presented here. \nSimple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the \nground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on \nthe pit\'s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris. \nThe DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the \ncloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, \ntaking damage based on the pit\'s depth (usually 10 feet, \nbut some pits are deeper). \nHidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from \nmaterial identical to the floor around it. \nA successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check \ndiscerns an absence of foot traffic over the section \nof floor that forms the pit\'s cover. A successful DC \n15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to \nconfirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the \ncover of a pit. \nWhen a creature steps on the cover, it swings open \nlike a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the \npit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can \nbe deeper. \nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar \nobject can be wedged between the pit\'s cover and the \nsurrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover \nfrom opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover \ncan also be magically held shut using the arcane lock \nspell or similar magic. \nLocking Pit. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit \ntrap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers \nthe pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, \nthe cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside. \nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to \npry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open \n(determine the cover\'s statistics using the guidelines \nin chapter 8). A character in the pit can also attempt to \ndisable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC \n'},

  'text': '15 Dexterity check using thieves\' tools, provided that the \nmechanism can be reached and the character can see. \nIn some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a \nsecret door nearby) opens the pit. \nSpiked Pit. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or \nlocking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes \nat the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 \n(2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to \nany falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison \nsmeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking \npiercing damage from the spikes must also make a \nDC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) \npoison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage \non a successful one. \nPOISON DARTS \nMechanical trap \nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, \npoison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or \npressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding \nwalls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, \neach one rigged to its own set of darts. \nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and \ncobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or \nfrescoes that adorn the walls. The DC tq spot them is \n15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) \ncheck, a character can deduce the presence of the \npressure plate from variations in the mortar and \nstone used to create it, compared to the surrounding \nfloor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the \npressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing \nthe holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained \nwithin from launching. \nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of \nweight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four \ndarts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus \nagainst a random target within 10 feet of the pressure \nplate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are \nno targets in the area, the darts don\'t hit anything.) A \ntarget that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must \nucceed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking \n11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as \nmuch damage on a successful one. \nPOISON NEEDLE \nJ1echanical trap \nA poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest\'s \nlock, or in something else that a creature might open. \nOpening the chest without the proper key causes the \nneedle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison. \nWhen the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 \nmches straight out from the lock. A creature within \nrange takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison \nam age, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution \n-aving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. \nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check \nallows a character to deduce the trap\'s presence from \nal£erations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. \n_ \n_,_ uccessful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves\' \ntools disarms the trap, removing the needle from \nthe lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock \ntriggers the trap. \nROLLING SPHERE \nMechanical trap \nWhen 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this \ntrap\'s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling \nopens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of \nsolid stone. \nWith a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, \na cb.aracter can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate . . \nA search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC \n15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations \nin the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate\'s \npresence. The same check made while inspecting the \nceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the \ntrapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under \nthe pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. \nActivation of the sphere requires all creatures present \nto roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 \nbonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. \nThe sphere can move through creatures\' spaces, and \ncreatures can move through its space, treating it as \ndifficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature\'s \nspace or a creature enters its space while it\'s rolling, \nthat creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving \nthrow or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be \nknocked prone. \nThe sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. \nIt can\'t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders \nincorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages \nthat allow the sphere to keep moving. \nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can \nattempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. \nOn a successful check, the sphere\'s speed is reduced by \n15 feet. If the sphere\'s speed drops to 0, it stops moving \nand is no longer a threat. \nSPHERE OF ANNIHILATION \nMagic trap \nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth \nof a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in \ndiameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, \nno light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter \nthat enters it is instantly obliterated. \nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check \nreveals that the mouth contains a sphere of annihilation \nthat can\'t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise \nidentical to a normal sphere of annihilation, as \ndescribed in chapter 7, "Treasure." \nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment \nplaced on the stone face, such that specified creatures \nfeel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl \ninside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the \nsympathy aspect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. \nA successful dispel magic (DC 18) removes this \nenchantment. \n'},

  'text': 'CHAPTER 6: BETWEEN ADVENTURES \nCAMPAIGN IS MUCH MORE THAN A SERIES OF \nadventures. It also includes the moments \nbetween them-the various distractions and \nside pursuits that engage the characters \nwhen they\'re not exploring the wilderness, \nplundering dungeons, and gallivanting \naround the multiverse on some epic quest. \nThe natural pace of a campaign offers lulls between \nadventures, time for the characters to spend their \ntreasure and pursue their goals. This downtime gives \nthe characters an opportunity to sink their roots a little \ndeeper into the world, building a personal investment \nin what happens to the people and places around them, \nwhich can, in turn, draw them into further adventures. \nChapter 5, "Equipment," of the Player\'s Handbook \ndetails the expenses that a character incurs for \nbasic necessities, depending on the lifestyle the \ncharacter chooses, from poverty to luxury. Chapter \n8, "Adventuring," of that book describes some of \nthe downtime activities they can pursue between \nadventures. This chapter fills in the gaps, describing \nthe expenses of owning property and hiring NPCs, and \na variety of additional downtime activities characters \ncan pursue. The beginning of the chapter also offers \nsuggestions for linking adventures together and keeping \ntrack of events in your campaign. \nLINKING ADVENTURES \nA campaign in the style of an episodic television show \nrarely needs story links between its adventures. Each \nadventure features its own villains, and once the \ncharacters complete the adventure, there are typically \nno loose plot threads. The next adventure presents \nan altogether different challenge having nothing to do \nwith the adventure that preceded it. As the characters \ngain experience points, they become more powerful, \nas do the threats they must overcome. This kind of \ncampaign is easy to run, since it requires little effort \nbeyond finding or creating adventures appropriate for \nthe party\'s level. \nA campaign with a narrative lets the players feel as \nthough their actions have far-reaching consequences. \nThey\'re not just racking up experience points. A few \nsimple modifications can help you overlay overarching \nelements to create a serialized campaign in which early \nadventures help set up later ones. \nUSING AN 0VERARCHING STORY \nThis section presents a couple of examples of \noverarching stories which have, over the years, fueled \nmany classic D&amp;D campaigns. \nThe adventurers\' goal in the first example is to amass \nthe power they need to defeat a powerful enemy that \nthreatens the world. Their goal in the second example \nis to defend something they care about by destroying \nwhatever threatens it. The two examples are, in effect, \nthe same story (variations of the battle between good \nand evil) told in different ways. \nEXAMPLE 1: THE QUEST OF MANY PARTS \nYou can tie adventures together using an overarching \ngoal that can be fulfilled only by first completing a series \nof related quests. For example, you could create a villain \nwho can\'t be defeated until the characters explore nine \ndungeons in which the Nine Dread Princes reside, with \neach of these dungeons stocked with enough monsters \nand hazards to advance the adventurers two or three \nlevels. The adventurers spend their whole careers \nfighting the Nine Dread Princes before finally pursuing \nan epic quest to destroy the princes\' monstrous \nprogenitor. As long as every dungeon is unique and \ninteresting, your players will appreciate the tight focus \nof the campaign. \nIn a similar type of quest campaign, the adventurers \nmight need to collect fragments of an artifact that \nare scattered in ruins across the multi verse, before \nreassembling the artifact and using it to defeat a \ncosmic threat. \nExAMPLE 2: AGENTS OF X \nYou can also build a campaign around the idea that \nthe adventurers are agents of something larger than \nthemselves-a kingdom or secret organization, for \nexample. Wherever their allegiance lies, the adventurers \nare motivated by loyalty and the goal of protecting \nwhatever it is they serve. \nThe characters\' overarching mission might be to \nexplore and map an uncharted region, forging alliances \nwhere they can and overcoming threats they encounter \nalong the way. Their goal might be to find the ancient \ncapital of a fallen empire, which lies beyond the realm \nof a known enemy and forces them to navigate hostile \nterritory. The characters could be pilgrims in search \nof a holy site or members of a secret order dedicated \nto defending the last bastions of civilization in an ever-\ndeclining world. Or they might be spies and assassins, \nstriving to weaken an enemy country by targeting its evil \nleaders and plundering its treasures. \nPLANTING ADVENTURE SEEDS \nYou can make a campaign feel like one story with many \nchapters by planting the seeds of the next adventure \nbefore the current one is finished. This technique can \nnaturally moves the characters along to their next goal. \nIf you\'ve planted a seed well, the characters have \nsomething else to do when they finish an adventure. \nPerhaps a character drinks from a magic fountain in a \ndungeon and receives a mystifying vision that leads to \nthe next quest. The party might find a cryptic map or \nrelic that, once its meaning or purpose is determined, \npoints to a new destination. Perhaps an NPC warns \nthe characters of impending danger or implores \nthem for help. \nThe trick is to not distract the characters from the \nadventure at hand. Designing an effective hook for a \nfuture adventure requires finesse. The lure should be \ncompelling, but not so irresistible that the players stop \ncaring about what their characters are doing right now. \nCHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN ADVENTURES \n(\n\\\n125 \n'},

  'text': "To keep players from straying, save your best ideas for \nthe very end of your adventures, or insert them during \nperiods of downtime. \nHere are a few examples of ways in which an \nadventure seed can be revealed: \nOn a villain's corpse, the characters find evidence that \nthe villain was working for someone else. \nA captured NPC reveals the location of someone or \nsomething that might interest the characters. \nThe characters are heading to a local tavern when \nthey spot a wanted poster or a missing person poster \n(complete with the promise of a sizable reward). \n• Members of the local militia or city watch put out the \nword that a crime has been committed, and they're \nlooking for potential witnesses and suspects. \n• The characters receive an anonymous letter that \nsheds light on a plot or impending event of which they \nwere previously unaware. \nFORESHADOWING -------------------\nForeshadowing is an exercise in subtlety, involving the \ndelicate planting of seeds for future adventures. Not all \nforeshadowing bears fruit, particularly if the clues are \ntoo subtle or if events conspire to take your campaign \nin a new direction. The goal of foreshadowing is to hint \nat upcoming events and new threats in your campaign \nwithout making it obvious to players that you're telling \nthem what the future holds. Here are a few examples: \n• An object worn or carried by an enemy has the symbol \nof a previously unknown organization engraved or \nwritten on it. \nA mad woman standing on a street corner spouts \nfragments of an ancient prophecy, while pointing a \ncrooked finger at the characters. \nThe king and queen announce the marriage of their \nson to the daughter of a neighboring monarch, but \nvarious factions oppose the union. Trouble is brewing. \nBugbear scouts are making incursions into civilized \nlands and spying on settlements, as a prelude to a \nhobgoblin warlord's invasion. \n· \n• A puppet show in a market square predicts a tragic \noutcome if two noble houses on the cusp of declaring \nwar on each other refuse to reconcile. \nNPC adventurers in a city are being murdered in a \nsimilar yet unusual manner, hinting at a future threat \nto the player characters. \nCAMPAIGN TRACKING \nConsistent details bring your campaign to life, and \ncontinuity helps players imagine that their characters \nare living in a real world. If the adventurers frequent \na particular tavern, the staff, layout of the building, \nand decor shouldn't change much from one visit to the \nnext. That said, changes can occur as a result of the \ncharacters' actions or of actions they learn about. When \nthe adventurers kill a monster, it stays dead, unless \nsomeone raises it. When they remove treasure from \na room, it doesn't reappear the next time they enter-\nassuming it hasn't been stolen from them! If they leave a \ndoor open, it should Stay open until someone closes it. \nCHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN ADVENTURES \nNo one's memory is infallible, so it pays to keep \nrecords. Jot notes directly on an adventure map to \nkeep track of open doors, disarmed traps, and the like. \nEvents beyond the scope of a single adventure are be \nrecorded in a notebook dedicated to your campaign. \nWhether it's a physical book or an electronic file, such_ \nrecord is a great way to keep your notes organized. \nYour notebook might include any of the \nfollowing elements. \nCampaign Planner. Write down the main story arc \nyour campaign, and keep track of things that you hope \nappear in future adventures. Update it as the campaigr:. \ndevelops, adding ideas as they come to you. \nCharacter Notes. Write down the characters' \nbackgrounds and goals, since these notes can help you \ndesign adventure content that provides opportunities ~ \ncharacter development. \nKeep a running tally of the adventurers' classes and \nlevels, as well as any quests and downtime activities \nthey're engaged in. \nIf the characters have a ship or stronghold, record iL \nname and whereabouts, as well as any hirelings in the \ncharacters' employ. \nPlayer Handouts. Keep a copy of all handouts \nyou make for your players so that you don't have to \nremember their contents later. \nAdventure Log. Think of this log as an episode guide \nfor your campaign. Summarize each game session \nor adventure to help you keep track of the unfolding \ncampaign story. You can give your players access to thE \nlog as well, or to an edited version stripped of your nor · \nand secrets. (The players might also keep their own \nrecord of adventures, which you can refer to if your ow-\nlog is incomplete.) \nNPC Nqtes. Record statistics and roleplaying notes \nfor any NPC the characters interact with more than \nonce. For example, your notes might differentiate \nimportant people in a town by their different voices, \nas well as their names, the places where they live \nand work, the names of their family members and \nassociates, and maybe even a secret that each one \nof them has. \nCampaign Calendar. Your world feels more real to \nyour players when the characters notice the passage of \ntime. Note details such as the change of seasons and \nmajor holidays, and keep track of any important event \nthat affect the larger story. \nToolbox. Keep notes whenever you create or \nsignificantly alter a monster, magic item, or trap. Keep \nany maps, random dungeons, or encounters you create. \nThis information ensures you won't repeat your work. \nand you'll be able to draw on this material later. \nRECURRING EXPENSES \nBesides the expenses associated with maintaining a \nparticular lifestyle, adventurers might have additional \ndrains on their adventuring income. Player characters \nwho come into possession of property, own businesses. \nand employ hirelings must cover the expenses that \naccompany these ventures. \n"},

  'text': 'MoRE Do-\\\\~TIME AcTn~TIE \nChapter 8, ··Adventuring:· of the Player· Handbook \ndescribes a few downtime activities to fill the Yoid \nbetween adventures. Depending on the style of your \ncampaign and the particular backgrounds and interests \nof the adventurers, you can make some or all of the \nfollowing additional activities available as options. \nB U I LDING A STRONGHOLD \nA character can spend time between adventures \nbuilding a stronghold. Before work can begin, the \ncharacter must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies \nwithin a kingdom or similar domain, the character \nwill need a royal charter (a legal document granting \npermission to oversee the estate in the name of the \ncrown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing \ncustody of the land to the character for as long as he \nor she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal \ndocument that serves as proof of ownership). Land can \nalso be acquired by inheritance or other means. \nRoyal charters and land grants are usually given by \nthe crown as a reward for faithful service, although they \ncan also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A \nsmall estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much \nas 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, \nif it can be bought at all. \nOnce the estate is secured, a character needs access \nto building materials and laborers. The Building \na Stronghold table shows the cost of building the \nstronghold (including materials and labor) and the \namount of time it takes, provided that the character \nis using downtime to oversee construction. Work can \ncontinue while the character is away, but each day the \ncharacter is away adds 3 days to the construction time. \nBUILDING A STRONGHOLD \nConstruction \nConstruction \nStronghold \nCost \nTime \nAbbey \n50,000 gp \n400 days \nGuildhall, town or city \n5,000 gp \n60 days \nKeep or small castle \n50,000 gp \n400 days \nNoble estate with manor \n25,000 gp \n150 days \nOutpost or fort \n15,000 gp \n100 days \nPalace or large castle \n500,000 gp \n1,200 days \nTemple \n50,000 gp \n400 days \nTower, fortified \n15,000 gp \n100 days \nTrading post \n5,000 gp \n60 days \nCAROUSING \nCharacters can spend their downtime engaged in a \nvariety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties, \nbinge drinking, gambling, or anything else that helps \nthem cope with the perils they face on their adventures. \nA carousing character spends money as though \nmaintaining a wealthy lifestyle (see chapter 5, \n"Equipment," of the Player\'s Handbook). At the end of \nthe period spent carousing, the player rolls percentile \ndice and adds the character\'s level, then compares the \ntotal to the Carousing table to determine what happens \nto the character, or you choose. \nCHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN A DVENTURES \nCA \n....

As an option, you \ncan allow player characters to craft magic items. \nThe creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive \ntask. To start, a character must have a formula that \ndescribes the construction of the item. The character \nmust also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must \nbe able to cast any spells that the item can produce. \nMoreover, the character must meet a level minimum \ndetermined by the item\'s rarity, as shown in the Crafting \nMagic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character \ncould create a wand of magic missiles (an uncommon \nitem), as long as the character has spell slots and can \n'},

That same character could make \na +1 weapon (another uncommon item), no particular \nspell required. \nYou can decide that certain items also require special \nmaterials or locations to be created.

The character is ass limed to work for 8 \n._,ours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon \n;:nagic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to \nadjust the costs to better suit your campaign. \nIf a spell will be produced by the item being created, \n-· e creator must expend one spell slot of the spell\'s \n,-eJ for each day of the creation process.

A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple \nor assist a priest with a rite. \nA character who spends at least 10 days performing \nsacred rites gains inspiration (described in chapter 4 of \nthe Player\'s Handbook) at the start of each day for the \nnext 2d6 days. \nRUNNING A BUSINESS \nAdventurers can end up owning businesses that have \nnothing to do with delving into dungeons or saving the \nworld. A character might inherit a smithy, or the party \nmight be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a \nreward. If they hold on to the business, they might feel \nobliged to spend time between adventures maintaining \nthe venture and making sure it runs smoothly. \nA character rolls percentile dice and adds the number \nof days spent on this downtime activity (maximum 30), \nthen compares the total to the Running a Business table \nto determine what happens. \nIf the character is required to pay a cost as a result \nof rolling on this table but fails to do so, the business \nbegins to fail.

  'text': 'S OWING R UMORS \nwaying public opinion can be an effective way to bring \ndown a villain or elevate a friend. Spreading rumors \nis an efficient, if underhanded, way to accomplish that \ngoal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject\'s \n-randing in a community or embroil someone in \nscandal.

An effective rumor also has to be believable, \nplaying off what people want to believe about the person \nin question. \nSowing a rumor about an individual or organization \n-equires a number of days depending on the size of the \ncommunity, as shown in the Sowing Rumors table. In a \nown or city, the time spent must be continuous.

  'text': 'CHAPTER 7: TREASURE \nDVENTURERS STRIVE FOR MANY THINGS, \nincluding glory, knowledge, and justice. \nMany adventurers also seek something more \ntangible: fortune. Strands of golden chains, \nstacks of platinum coins, bejeweled crowns, \nenameled scepters, bolts of silk cloth, and \npowerful magic items all wait to be seized or unearthed \nby intrepid, treasure-seeking adventurers. \nThis chapter details magic items and the placement of \ntreasure in an adventure, as well as special rewards that \ncan be granted instead of or in addition to magic items \nand mundane treasure. \nTYPES OF TREASURE \nTreasure comes in many forms. \nCoins. The most basic type of treasure is money, \nincluding copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), electrum \npieces (ep), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp). \nFifty coins of any type weigh 1 pound. \nGemstones. Gemstones are small, lightweight, and \neasily secured compared to their same value in coins. \nee the "Gemstones" section for types of stones, gems, \nand jewels that can be found as treasure. \nArt Objects. Idols cast of solid gold, necklaces \ntudded with precious stones, paintings of ancient \nkings, bejeweled dishes- art objects include all these \nand more. See the "Art Objects" sectiori for types of \ndecorative and valuable artworks that can be found \nas treasure. \nMagic Items. Types of magic items include armor, \npotions, scrolls, rings, rods, staffs, wands, weapons, \nand wondrous items. Magic items also have rarities: \ncommon, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary. \nIntelligent monsters often use magic items in their \npossession, while others might hide them away to \nensure they don\'t get lost or stolen. For example, if a \nhobgoblin tribe has a +llongsword and an alchemy jug \nin its treasure hoard, the tribe\'s warlord might wield the \nword, while the jug is kept somewhere safe. \nRANDOM TREASURE \nThe following pages contain tables that you can use \nto randomly generate treasures carried by monsters, \ntashed in their lairs, or otherwise hidden away. The \nplacement of treasure is left to your discretion. The key \nis to make sure the players feel rewarded for playing, \nand that their characters are rewarded for overcoming \ndangerous challenges. \nTREASURE TABLES \nTreasure can be randomly allocated based on a \nmonster\'s challenge rating. There are tables for \nchallenge rating 0- 4, challenge rating 5- 10, challenge \nrating 11- 16, and challenge rating 17 and higher. Use \nthese tables to randomly determine how much money \nan individual monster carries (the D&amp;D equivalent of \npocket change) or the amount of wealth found in a larger \ntreasure hoard. \n\'\nUSING THE INDIVIDUAL TREASURE TABLES \nAn Individual Treasure table helps you randomly \ndetermine how much treasure one creature carries on \nits person. If a monster has no interest in amassing \ntreasure, you can use this table to determine the \nincidental treasure left behind by the monster\'s victims. \nUse the Individual Treasure table that corresponds to \nthe monster\'s challenge rating. Roll a dlOO, and read the \nresult across to determine how many coins of each type \nthe monster carries. The table also includes the average \nresult in parentheses, should you wish to forgo another \nroll and save time. To determine the total amount of \nindividual treasure for a group of similar creatures, you \ncan save time by rolling once and multiplying the result \nby the number of creatures in the group. \nIf it doesn\'t make sense for a monster to carry a large \npile of coins, you can convert the coins into gemstones \nor art objects of equal value. \nUSING THE TREASURE HOARD TABLES \nA Treasure Hoard table helps you randomly determine \nthe contents of a large cache of treasure, the \naccumulated wealth of a large group of creatures (such \nas an ore tribe or a hobgoblin army), the belongings of \na single powerful creature that likes to hoard treasure \n(such as a dragon), or the reward bestowed upon a party \nafter completing a quest for a benefactor. You can also \nsplit up a treasure hoard so that the adventurers don\'t \nfind or receive it all at once. \nWhen determining the contents of a hoard belonging \nto one monster, use the table that corresponds to that \nmonster\'s challenge rating. When rolling to determine a \ntreasure hoard belonging to a large group of monsters, \nuse the challenge rating of the monster that leads the \ngroup. If the hoard belongs to no one, use the challenge \nrating of the monster that presides over the dungeon \nor lair you are stocking. If the hoard is a gift from a \nbenefactor, use the challenge rating equal to the party\'s \naverage level. \nEvery treasure hoard contains a random number of \ncoins, as shown at the top of each table. Roll a dlOO and \nconsult the table to determine how many gemstones or \nart objects the hoard contains, if any. Use the same roll \nto determine whether the hoard contains magic items. \nAs with the individual treasure tables, average values \nare given in parentheses. You can use an average value \ninstead of rolling dice to save time. \nIf a treasure hoard seems too small, you can roll \nmultiple times on the table. Use this approach for \nmonsters that are particularly fond of amassing \ntreasure. Legendary creatures that accumulate treasure \nare wealthier than normal. Always roll at least twice on \nthe appropriate table and add the results together. \nYou can hand out as much or as little treasure as you \nwant. Over the course of a typical campaign, a party \nfinds treasure hoards amounting to seven rolls on the \nChallenge 0- 4 table, eighteen rolls on the Challenge \n5- 10 table, twelve rolls on the Challenge 11- 16 table, \nand eight rolls on the Challenge 17+ table. \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \n133 \n'},

Such \nitems grant capabilities a character could rarely \nhave otherwise, or they complement their owner's \ncapabilities in wondrous ways. \nRARITY \nEach magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon, \nrare, very rare, or legendary. Common magic items, \nsuch as a potion of healing, are the most plentiful. Some \nlegendary items, such as the apparatus of Kwalish, are \nunique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating \nthe most powerful items arose centuries ago and were \nthen gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and \nmishaps. Even uncommon items can't be easily created. \nThus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities. \nRarity provides a rough measure of an item's power \nrelative to other magic items. Each rarity corresponds \nto character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity . \ntable. A character doesn't typically find a rare magic \nitem, for example, until around 5th level. That said, \nrarity shouldn't get in the way of your campaign's story. \nIf you want a ring of invisibility to fall into the hands of \na 1st-level character, so be it. No doubt a great story will \narise from that event. \nIf your campaign allows for trade in magic items, \nrarity can also help you set prices for them. As the DM, \nyou determine the value of an individual magic item \nbased on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in \nthe Magic Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable \nitem, such as a potion or scroll, is typically half the value \nof a permanent item of the same rarity. \nMAGIC ITEM RARITY \nRarity \nCharacter Level \nValue \nCommon \n1st or higher \n50-100 gp \nUncommon \n1st or higher \n101-500 gp \nRare \n5th or higher \n501 -5,000 gp \nVery rare \n11th or higher \n5,001 - 50,000 gp \nLegendary \n17th or higher \n50,001+ gp \nBUYING AND SELLING \nUnless you decide your campaign works otherwise, \nmost magic items are so rare that they aren't available \nfor purchase. Common items, such as a potion of \nhealing, can be procured from an alchemist, herbalist, \nor spellcaster. Doing so is rarely as simple as walking \ninto a shop and selecting an item from a shelf. The seller \nmight ask for a service, rather than coin. \nIn a large city with an academy of magic or a major \ntemple, buying and selling magic items might be \npossible, at your discretion. If your world includes a \nlarge number of adventurers engaged in retrieving \nancient magic items, trade in these items might be more \ncommon. Even so, it's likely to remain similar to the \nmarket for fine art in the real world, with invitation-only \nauctions and a tendency to attract thieves. \nSelling magic items is difficult in most D&amp;D worlds \nprimarily because of the challenge of finding a buyer. \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \n135 \n"},

See \nchapter 6, "Between Adventures," for one way to handle \nselling magic items. \nIn your campaign, magic items might be prevalent \nenough that adventurers can buy and sell them with \nsome effort. Magic items might be for sale in bazaars or \nauction houses in fantastical locations, such as the City \nof Brass, the planar metropolis of Sigil, or even in more \nordinary cities. Sale of magic items might be highly \nregulated, accompanied by a thriving black market. \nArtificers might craft items for use by military forces \nor adventurers, as they do in the world of Eberron. You \nmight also allow characters to craft their own magic \nitems, as discussed in chapters 6. \nIDENTIFYING A MAGIC ITEM \nSome magic items are indistinguishable from their \nnonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items \ndisplay their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a \nmagic item\'s appearance, handling the item is enough to \ngive a character a sense that something is extraordinary \nabout it. Discovering a magic item\'s properties isn\'t \nautomatic, however. \nThe identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an \nitem\'s properties.

At the end of the rest, the \ncharacter learns the item\'s properties, as well as how \nto use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is \nenough to tell the taster what the potion does. \nSometimes a magic item carries a clue to its \nproperties. The command word to activate a ring mighr \nbe etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design \nmight suggest that it\'s a ring of feather falling. \nWearing or experimenting with an item can also offer \nhints about its properties. For example, if a character \nputs on a ring of jumping, you could say, "Your steps fee \nstrangely springy." Perhaps the character then jumps \nup and down to see what happens. You then say the \ncharacter jumps unexpectedly high. \nVARIANT: MORE DIFFICULT IDENTIFICATION \nIf you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, \nconsider removing the ability to identify the properties \nof a magic item during a short rest, and require the \nidentify spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a \nmagic item does. \nATTUNEMENT \nSome magic items require a creature to form a bond \nwith them before their magical properties can be used. \nThis bond is called attunement, and certain items \nhave a prerequisite for it.

A magic item meant to be worn must be \ndonned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, \ngloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and \nrings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a \nshield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the \nshoulders. A weapon must be held in hand. \nIn most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn \ncan fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many \nmagic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or the: \nmagically adjust themselves to the wearer. \nRare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good \nreason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain \nsize or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust.

For instance, \na fireball might produce an area of harmless \ncold. \nThe caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect \nrelated to the spell. Such effects last only \nas long as the original spell's duration, or \n1d10 minutes for spells that take effect \ninstantaneously. For example, a fireball might \ncause smoke to billow from the caster's ears for \n1d10 minutes. \nThe spell activates after 1d12 hours.

For example, a character \nwearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and \na boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit \nfrom either item. \nAC TIVAT I NG AN I TEM \nActivating some magic items requires a user to do \nomething special, such as holding the item and uttering \na command word. The description of each item category \nor individual item details how an item is activated. \nCertain items use one or more of the following rules for \ntheir activation. \nIf an item requires an action to activate, that action \nisn\'t a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature \nsuch as the rogue\'s Fast Hands can\'t be used to \nactivate the item. \nC OMMAND WORD \nA command word is a word or phrase that must be \npoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires \na command word can\'t be activated in an area where \nound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell. \nC ONSUMABLES \nSome items are used up when they are activated. A \npotion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied \nto the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is \nread. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. \nMAGIC ITEM FORMULAS \nA magic item formula explains how to make a particular \nmagic item. Such a formula can be an excellent reward if you \nallow player characters to craft magic items, as explained in \nchapter 6, "Between Adventures." \nYou can award a formula in place of a magic item. Usually \nwritten in a book or on a scroll, a formula is one step rarer \nthan the item it allows a character to create. For example, \nthe formula for a common magic item is uncommon. No \nformulas exist for legendary items. \nIf the creation of magic items is commonplace in your \ncampaign, a formula can have a rarity that matches the \nrarity of the item it allows a character to create. Formulas for \ncommon and uncommon items might even be for sale, each \nwith a cost double that of its magic item. \nSPELLS \nS ome magic items allow the user to cast a spell from \nthe item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell \nlevel, doesn\'t expend any of the user\'s spell slots, and \nrequires no components, unless the item\'s description \nsays otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, \nrange, and duration, and the user of the item must \nconcentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many \nitems, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell \nand confer the spell\'s effects, with their usual duration. \nCertain items make exceptions to these rules, changing \nthe casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. \nA magic item, such as certain staffs, may require \nyou to use your own spellcasting ability when you \ncast a spell from the item. If you have more than one \nspellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with \nthe item. If you don\'t have a spellcasting ability-perhaps \nyou\'re a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature- your \nspellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your \nproficiency bonus does apply. \nCHARGES \nSome magic items have charges that must be expended \nto activate their properties. The number of charges an \nitem has remaining is revealed when an identify spell \nis cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. \nAdditionally, when an item regains charges, the creature \nattuned to it learns how many charges it regained. \nMAGIC I T EM R ESILIENCE \nMost magic items are objects of extraordinary \nartisanship. Thanks to a combination of careful crafting \nand magical reinforcement, a magic item is at least as \ndurable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic \nitems, other than potions and scrolls, have resistance \nto all damage. Artifacts are practically indestructible, \nrequiring extraordinary measures to destroy. \nSPECIAL FEATURES \nYou can add distinctiveness to a magic item by thinking \nabout its backstory. Who made the item? Is anything \nunusual about its construction? Why was it made, and \nhow was it originally used? What minor magical quirks \nset it apart from other items of its kind? Answering \nthese questions can help turn a generic magic item, \nsuch as a +llongsword, into a more flavorful discovery. \nThe tables that follow can help you come up with \nanswers. Roll on as many of these tables as you like. \nSome of the table entries make more sense for certain \nitems than for others. Some magic items are made \nonly by certain kinds of creatures, for instance; a cloak \nof elvenkind is made by elves, rather than dwarves. If \nyou roll something that doesn\'t make sense, roll again, \nchoose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail \nas inspiration to make up your own. \nVARIANT: WANDS THAT DoN\'T RECHARGE \nA typical wand has expendable charges. If you\'d like wands to \nbe a limited resource, you can make some of them incapable \nof regaining charges. Consider increasing the base number of \ncharges in such a wand, to a maximum of25 charges. These \ncharges are never regained once they\'re expended. \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \n'},

The barrel has a hidden catch, \nwhich can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence \n(Investigation) check.

Ten levers are set in \na row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to \nmove either up or down. When certain levers are used, \nthe apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. \nThe apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the \nfollowing statistics: \nArmor Class: 20 \nHit Points: 200 \nSpeed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and \ntail aren't extended) \nDamage Immunities: poison, psychic \nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. \nWhile the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment \nis airtight and watertight. The compartment holds \nenough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the \nnumber of breathing creatures inside. \nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go \nunderwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the \nvehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute \nfrom pressure. \nAPPARATUS OF K W A LIS H \nA creature in the compartment can use an action to \nmove as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or \ndown.

Some are more focused \nthan others; for example, there are both arrows of \ndragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a \ncreature belonging to the type, race, or group associated \nwith an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, \nthe creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving \nthrow, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed \nsave, or half as much extra damage on a successful one. \nOnce an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a \ncreature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow. \nOther types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, \nsuch as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though \narrows are most common. \nBAG OF BEANS \nWondrous item, rare \nInside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The \nbag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean \nit contains. \nIf you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they \nexplode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. \nEach creature in the area, including you, must make a \nDC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage \non a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful \none. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that \naren't being worn or carried. \nIf you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or \nsand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect \n1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. \nThe DM can choose an effect from the following table, \ndetermine it randomly, or create an effect. \n"},

Animal or \nvegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured \nand lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed \nin the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, \nthere is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled \ninside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its \naction to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength \ncheck. Another creature can use its action to reach into \nthe bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful \nDC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the \nbag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag \nis devoured, its body destroyed. \nInanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which \ncan hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once \neach day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and \nspits them out into another plane of existence.

The bag can hold up to \n500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. \nThe bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. \nRetrieving an item from the bag requires an action. \nIf the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures \nand is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \n153 \n"},

The manual then loses its magic, but \nregains it in a century. \nM ARINER's ARMOR \nArmor (light, medium, or heavy), uncommon \nWhile wearing this armor, you have a swimming speed \nequal to your walking speed. In addition, whenever you \nstart your turn underwater with 0 hit points, the armor \ncauses you to rise 60 feet toward the surface. The armor \nis decorated with fish and shell motifs. \nM EDALLION OF THOUGHTS \nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) \nThe medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can \nuse an action and expend 1 charge to cast the detect \nthoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion \nregains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. \nM IRROR OF LIFE TRAPPING \nWondrous item, very rare \nWhen this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its \nsurface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror \nweighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and \nvulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is \ndestroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. \nIf the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you \nare within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its \ncommand word and activate it. It remains activated until \nyou use an action to speak the command word again. \nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection \nin the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must \nsucceed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be \ntrapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in \none of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This \nsaving throw is made with advantage if the creature \nknows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on \nthe saving throw automatically. \nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled \nwith thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures \ntrapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't \nneed to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within \na cell can escape using magic that permits planar \ntravel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell \nuntil freed. \nMIRROR OF \nLIFE TRAPPING \nMANUAL OF \nBODILY 11EALTH \nMEDALLION \nOF THOUGHTS \nQuiCKNESs OF AcTION \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \n• \nr8r \n"},

A freed creature appears in an \nunoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing \naway from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures \nit contains are freed and appear in unoccupied \nspaces near it. \nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an \naction to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or \ncall out a particular cell by number. The creature named \nor contained in the named cell appears as an image \non the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then \ncommunicate normally. \nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a \nsecond command word and free one creature trapped \nin the mirror.

A necklace can have more than one bead of \nthe same type. To use one, you must be wearing the \nnecklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast \nfrom it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a \nsave is necessary).

If you score a critical \nhit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, \nit must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or \nbe slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its \nbody (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword \nloses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword \nhas no charges remaining, it loses this property. \nNOLZUR\'S MARVELOUS PIGMENTS \nWondrous item, very rare \nTypically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box \nwith a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments \nallow you to create three-dimensional objects by \npainting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from \nthe brush to form the desired object as you concentrate \non its image. \nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square \nfeet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects \nor terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, \ncells, rooms, or weapons- that are up to 10,000 cubic \nfeet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet. \nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain \nfeature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. \nThus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door \nthat can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit \non a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against \nthe total area of objects you create. \nNothing created by the pigments can have a value \ngreater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value \n(such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks \nauthentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from \npaste, bone, or some other worthless material. \nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, \nthe energy appears but dissipates as soon as you \ncomplete the painting, doing no harm to anything. \n0ATHBOW \nWeapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement) \nWhen you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in \nElvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies."

The target of your attack becomes your \nsworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. \nYou can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. \nWhen your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new \none after the next dawn. \nWhen you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon \nagainst your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the \nroll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, \nother than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage \ndue to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy \ntakes an extra 3d6 piercing damage. \nWhile your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage \non attack rolls with all other weapons. \nOIL OF ETHEREALNESS \nPotion, rare \nBeads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its \ncontainer and quickly evaporate.

You can also draw on the \n"Special Features" section earlier in this chapter. \nIf you determine these characteristics randomly, \nignore or adapt any result that doesn\'t make sense \nfor an inanimate object. You can reroll until you get a \nresult you like. \nSPECIAL P U RPOSE \nYou can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, \nperhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the \nwielder\'s use of the item aligns with that special \npurpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from \nthis course might cause conflict between the wielder \nand the item, and could even cause the item to prevent \nthe use of its activated properties. You can pick a special \npurpose or roll on the following table. \ndlO \nPurpose \nAligned: The item seeks to defeat or destroy those \nof a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an \nitem is never neutral.) \n2 \nBane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures \nof a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, \ntrolls, or wizards. \n3 \nProtector: The item seeks to defend a particular \nrace or kind of creature, such as elves or druids. \n4 \nCrusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or \ndestroy the servants of a particular deity. \n5 \nTemplar: The item seeks to defend the servants \nand interests of a particular deity. \n6 \nDestroyer: The item craves destruction and goads \nits user to fight arbitrarily. \n7 \nGlory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the \ngreatest magic item in the world , by establishing \nits user as a famous or notorious figure. \n• \n8 \nLore Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is \ndetermined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or \nunravel a cryptic prophecy. \n9 \nDestiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its \nwielder have key roles to play in future events. \n10 \nCreator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and \nwants to understand why it was created. \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \nCONFLICT \nA sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its \npersonality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a \nmanner opposed to the item\'s alignment or purpose, \nconflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item \nmakes a Charisma check contested by the wielder\'s \nCharisma check. If the item wins the contest, it make \none or more of the following demands: \nThe item insists on being carried or worn at all times \nThe item demands that its wielder dispose of anything \nthe item finds repugnant. \n• The item demands that its wielder pursue the item\'s \ngoals to the exclusion of all other goals. \nThe item demands to be given to someone else. \nIf its wielder refuses to comply with the item\'s wishes \nthe item can do any or all of the following: \nMake it impossible for its wielder to attune to it. \nSuppress one or more of its activated properties. \nAttempt to take control of its wielder. \nIf a sentient item attempts to take control of its \nwielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving \nthrow, with a DC equal to 12 +the item\'s Charisma \nmodifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by \nitem for ld12 hours. While charmed, the wielder mus \ntry to follow the item\'s commands. If the wielder takes \ndamage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effe \non a success. Whether the attempt to control its user \nsucceeds or fails, the item can\'t use this power again \nuntil the next dawn. \nSAMPLE SENTIENT ITEMS \nThe sentient weapons described here have storied \nhistories. \nBLACKRAZOR \nWeapon (greats word), legendary (requires attunemenc \nby a creature of non-lawful alignment) \nHidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, \nBlackrazor shines like a piece of night sky filled with \nstars.

You also \ncan\'t be charmed or frightened. \nBlackrazor can cast the haste spell on you once per \nday. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains \nconcentration on it so that you don\'t have to. \nSentience. Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral \nweapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and \na Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a \nrange of 120 feet. \nThe weapon can speak, read, and understand \nCommon, and can communicate with its wielder \ntelepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you \nare attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every \nlanguage you know. \nPersonality. Blackrazor speaks with an imperious \ntone, as though accustomed to being obeyed. \nThe sword\'s purpose is to consume souls. It doesn\'t \ncare whose souls it eats, including the wielder\'s. The \nword believes that all matter and energy sprang from \na void of negative energy and will one day return to it. \nBlackrazor is meant to hurry that process along. \nDespite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange \nkinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked \naway under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three \nweapons to be united again and wielded together in \ncombat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm \nand finds Wave tedious. \nBlackrazor\'s hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If \nthe sword goes three days or more without consuming \na soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the \nnext sunset. \nM OONBLADE \nWeapon (longs word), legendary (requires attunement by \nan elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment) \nOf all the magic items created by the elves, one of the \nmost prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade. In \nancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one \nuch blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded \nfrom the world, their magic lost as family lines have \nbecome extinct. Other blades have vanished with their \nbearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these \nweapons remain. \nA moonblade passes down from parent to child. The \nsword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that \nperson for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can \nclaim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies \ndormant. It functions like a normallongsword until a \nworthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power. \nAmoonblade serves only one master at a time. The \nattunement process requires a special ritual in the \nthrone room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated \nto the elven gods. \nA moon blade won\'t serve anyone it regards as \ncraven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and \nprotecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make \nability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with \ndisadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you \nbecome attuned to it and a new rune appears on the \nblade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or \nthe weapon is destroyed. \nA moonblade has one rune on its blade for each \nmaster it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune \nalways grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls \nmade with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the \nfirst grants the moon blade an additional property. The \nDM chooses each property or determines it randomly on \nthe Moon Blade P roperties table. \nMOONBLADE PROPERTIES \nd1 00 \nProperty \n01-40 \nIncrease the bonus to attack and damage rolls by \n1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the moonblade \nalready has a +3 bonus. \n41-80 \nThe moonblade gai ns a randomly determined \nminor property (see "Special Features" earlier in \nthis chapter). \n81-82 \nThe moonblade gains the finesse property. \n83-84 \nThe moonblade gains the thrown property (range \n20/60 feet). \n85-86 \nThe moonblade functions as a defender. \n87-90 \nThe moon blade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 \nor 20. \n91-92 \nWhen you hit with an attack using the moon blade, \nthe attack an extra 1d6 slashing damage. \n93-94 \nWhen you hit a creature of a specific type (such as \ndragon , fiend , or undead) with the moonblade, the \ntarget takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these \ntypes: acid, cold, fire, lightning, o r thunder. \n95-96 \nYou can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade \nto flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and \nis within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 \nConstitution saving throw or become blinded for \n1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw \nat the end of each of its turns, ending the effect \non itself on a success. This property can\'t be used \nagain until you take a short rest while attuned to \nthe weapon . \n97-98 \nThe moonblade fun ctions as a ring of spell storing. \n99 \nYou can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, \nprovided that you don\'t already have one serving \nyou. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied \nspace within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics \nfor a shadow from the Monster Manual, except it \nis neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, \nand doesn\'t create new shadows. You control \nthis creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It \nremai ns until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss \nit as an action . \n00 \nThe moonblade functions as a vorpal sword. \nSentience.

  'text': "when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. \nIt can communicate more explicitly, through visions or \ndreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. \nPersonality. Every moonblade seeks the advancement \nof elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, \nmusic, and life are all part of this purpose. \nThe weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to \nserve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its \nideals, its loyalty is absolute. \nIf a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once \nit has decided on an owner, it believes that only that \nperson should wield it, even if the owner falls short of \nelven ideals. \nWAVE \nWeapon (trident), legendary (requires attunement by a \ncreature that worships a god of the sea) \nHeld in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this \ntrident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images \nof waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must \nworship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, Wave \nhappily accepts new converts. \nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made \nwith this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it, \nthe target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its \nhit point maximum. \nThe weapon also functions as a trident offish \ncommand and a weapon of warning. It can confer the \nbenefit of a cap of water breathing while you hold it, and \nyou can use it as a cube of force by choosing the effect, \ninstead of pressing cube sides to select it. \nSentience. Wave is a sentient weapon of neutral \nalignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, \nand a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out \nto a range of 120 feet. \nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its \nwielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It \ncan also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak \nwith animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder \nin the conversation. \nPersonality. When it grows restless, Wave has a habit \nof humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred \nhymns of the sea gods. \nWave zealously desires to convert mortals to the \nworship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the \nfaithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to \nfurther the weapon's objectives in the world. \nThe trident has a nostalgic attachment to the \nplace where it was forged, a desolate island called \nThunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm \ngiants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of \ndevotion to- or rebellion against-that god. \nWave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and \npurpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave fears \nthat it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's \ndemise. This destiny is something Wave might not be \nable to avert. \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \nWHELM \nWeapon (warhammer), legendary (requires attunemenc \nby a dwarf) \nWhelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves \nand lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain. \nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls \nmade with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after \nyou first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop \na fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you \nremain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have \ndisadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability \nchecks while you can see the daytime sky. \nThrown Weapon. Whelm has the thrown property, \nwith a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 \nfeet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using \nit, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or \nan extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a gian-\nEach time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your \nhand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the \nweapon lands at your feet. \nShock Wave. You can use an action to strike the \nground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from \nthe point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the \nground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a \nDC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for \n1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the \nend of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a \nsuccess. Once used, this property can't be used again \nuntil the next dawn. \nSupernatural Awareness. While you are holding \nthe weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or \nconcealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you \ncan use an action to cast detect evil and good or locate \nobject from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you \ncan't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn. \nSentience. Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon \nwith an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a \nCharisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a \nrange of 120 feet. \nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its \nwielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. \nGiant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish \nwhen used in combat. \nPersonality. Whelm's purpose is to slaughter giants \nand goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against \nall enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy \ngoblins and giants or to protect dwarves. \nWhelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, \nvariously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. \nIt longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything \nto protect those dwarves from harm. \nThe hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries \nago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for \na time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His \nwill was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil \npurposes, even killing members of his own clan. \n"},

  'text': "ARTIFACTS \nAn artifact is a unique magic item of tremendous power, \nwith its own origin and history. An artifact might have \nbeen created by gods or mortals of awesome power. \nIt could have been created in the midst of a crisis that \nthreatened a kingdom, a world, or the entire multiverse, \nand carry the weight of that pivotal moment in history. \nSome artifacts appear when they are needed most. \nFor others, the reverse is true; when discovered, the \nworld trembles at the ramifications of the find. In either \ncase, introducing an artifact into a campaign requires \nforethought. The artifact could be an item that opposing \nsides are hoping to claim, or it might be something the \nadventurers need to overcome their greatest challenge. \nCharacters don't typically find artifacts in the \nnormal course of adventuring. In fact, artifacts only \nappear when you want them to, for they are as much \nplot devices as magic items. Tracking down and \nrecovering an artifact is often the main goal of an \nadventure.

Use them as guides when creating \nyour own artifacts, or modify them as you see fit. \nAxE OF T H E D WARVISH LORDS \nWeapon (battleaxe), artifact (requires attunement) \neeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince \ncame to believe that his people needed something to \nunite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that \nwould be such a symbol. \nVenturing deep under the mountains, deeper than \nany dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to \nthe blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of \n:\\1oradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted \nfour great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, \nthe Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With \nthem, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords. \nArmed with the artifact, the prince returned to the \ndwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges \nand answered slights. The clans became allies, and \nthey threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era \nof prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as \nthe First King. When he became old, he passed the \nweapon, which had become his badge of office, to his \nheir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many \ngenerations. \nLater, in a dark era marked by treachery and \nwickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war \nfomented by greed for its power and the status it \nbestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for \nthe axe, and many adventurers have made careers of \nchasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. \nMagic Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is \na magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and \ndamage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a \nbelt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of \nsharpness. \nRandom Properties.

If you are holding the axe, \nyou can use your action to cast the conjure elemental \nspell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't \nuse this property again until the next dawn. \nTravel the Depths. You can use an action to touch the \naxe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the \nteleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination \nis underground, there is no chance of a mishap or \narriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this \nproperty again until 3 days have passed. \nCurse. The axe bears a curse that affects any non-\ndwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement \nends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the \ncreature's physical appearance and stature become \nmore dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like \na typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial \ntraits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical \nchanges wrought by the axe aren't considered magical \nin nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can \nbe undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a \ngreater restoration or remove curse spell. \nDestroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the \naxe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where \nit was created. It must remain in the burning forge for \nfifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and \nis consumed. \nBOOK OF EXALTED DEEDS \nWondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a \ncreature of good alignment) \nThe definitive treatise on all that is good in the \nmultiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures \nprominently in many religions. Rather than being a \nscripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various \nauthors filled the pages with their own vision of true \nvirtue, providing guidance for defeating evil. \nThe Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. \nAs soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other \ncorner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can \nbring light to a darkened world. Although attempts \nhave been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail \nto capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it \noffers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose. \nA heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, . \nkeeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of \ngood alignment that is attuned to the book can release \nthe clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, \nthe attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and \nstudying the book to digest its contents and gain its \nbenefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open \npages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning \nand reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read \nfrom the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage \nignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced \nor avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \npoints by this damage disappears in a blinding flash \nis destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. \nBenefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last \nonly as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to \nperform at least one act of kindness or generosity wit \nthe span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil \nact, you lose all the benefits granted by the book. \nRandom Properties. The Book of Exalted Deeds h~ \nthe following random properties: \n2 minor beneficial properties \n• 2 major beneficial properties \nIncreased Wisdom. After you spend the requisite \namount of time reading and studying the book, your \nWisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Y -\ncan't gain this benefit from the book more than once. \nEnlightened Magic. Once you've read and studied \nthe book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or \npaladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher. \nHalo. Once you've read and studied the book, you \ngain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light \nin a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additionallO \nfeet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus \naction. While present, the halo gives you advantage on \nCharisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with \ngood creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks \nmade to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends \nand undead within the halo's bright light make attack \nrolls against you with disadvantage. \nDestroying the Book. It is rumored that the Book 0: \nExalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exi .. \nin the multiverse.

No mortal was meant to know the secrets it \ncontains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the \nscrawled pages invites madness. \nMost believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book \nVile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseas \nidea, every unhinged thought, and every example of \nblackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna \ncovered every vile topic he could, making the book a \ngruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs. \nOther practitioners of evil have held the book and \nadded their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. \nTheir additions are clear, for the writers of later works \nstitched whatever they were writing into the tome or. ·-\nsome cases, made notations and additions to existing \ntext. There are places where pages are missing, torn. \nor covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches \nthat the original text can't be divined. \nNature can't abide the book's presence.

Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all \nwizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a \nterrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape \nhis own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps \nto prevent his end from ever coming about. \nOrcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a \nritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond \ndeath, he became the greatest of allliches. Even \nthough his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna \ncontinued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable \nand hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to \nspeak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master \nof the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of \nthe Rotted Tower. \nSome say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the \nSpider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord \nmade for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the \nreason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end \nin a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. \nOf Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, \ngrisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered \nOne's will in the world. \nThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might \nbe found together or separately. The eye looks like a \nbloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a \nmummified and shriveled left extremity. \nTo attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye \nand press the artifact into the empty socket.

One orb was taken \no each of the five towers, and there they were used to \n-peed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards \nu ed the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed \nthe dragons with powerful magic. \nAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the \norbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three \nare thought to survive. Their magic has been warped \nand twisted over the centuries, so although their \nprimary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they \nalso allow some measure of control over dragons. \nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a \npresence that resents any attempt to coax magic from \n·.

While you are holding the wand, you \ncan use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, \ncalling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit \npoints among, each undead having average hit points \n(see the Monster Manual for statistics). The undead \nmagically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in \nunoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your \ncommands until they are destroyed or until dawn of \nthe next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of \nbones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property \nof the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn. \nWhile attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any \nkind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The \nundead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following \nday, remaining until Orcus dismisses them. \nSentience. The Wand ofOrcus is a sentient, chaotic \nevil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and \na Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a \nrange of 120 feet. \nThe wand communicates telepathically with its \nwielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal \nand Common. \nPersonality. The wand's purpose is to help satisfy \nOrcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The \nwand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. \nIn order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns \ndevotion to its current user and makes grandiose \npromises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as \nvowing to help its user overthrow Orcus. \nDestroying the Wand. Destroying the Wand of Orcus \nrequires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by \nthe ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to \nhappen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life-\nno easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned \nthe hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded. \nBathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack \nand explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the \nwand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss. \nOTHER REWARDS \nAs much as adventurers desire treasure, they often \nappreciate other forms of reward. This section \npresents a variety of ways that gods, monarchs, and \nother beings of power might recognize the characters' \naccomplishments, including supernatural gifts that \ngive characters new capabilities; titles, lands, and other \nmarks of prestige; and boons that are available only to \nadventurers who have reached 20th level. \nSUPERNATURAL GIFTS \nA supernatural gift is a special reward granted \nby a being or force of great magical power. Such \nsupernatural gifts come in two forms: blessings and \ncharms. A blessing is usually bestowed by a god or \na godlike being. A charm is typically the work of a \npowerful spirit, a location of ancient magic, or a creature \nthat has legendary actions. Unlike a magic item, a \nsupernatural gift isn't an object and doesn't require \nattunement. It gives a character an extraordinary ability, \nwhich can be used one or more times. \nBLESSINGS \nA character might receive a blessing from a deity for \ndoing something truly momentous-an accomplishment \nthat catches the attention of both gods and mortals. \nKilling rampaging gnolls rarely warrants such a \nblessing, but slaying the high priest of Tiamat as he \nattempts to summon the Dragon Queen might. \nA blessing is an appropriate reward for one of the \nfollowing accomplishments: \n• Restoring the most sacred shrine of a god \n• Foiling an earthshaking plot by the enemies of a god \n• Helping a god's favored servant complete a holy quest \nAn adventurer might also receive a blessing in \nadvance of a perilous quest. For example, a paladin \ncould receive one before setting out on a quest to slay a \nterrifying lich that is responsible for a magical plague \nsweeping the land. \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \n227 \n"},

  'text': 'A character should receive only a blessing that is \nuseful to him or her, and some blessings come with \nexpectations on the part of the benefactor. A god \ntypically gives a blessing for a particular purpose, such \nas recovering a holy person\'s remains or toppling a \ntyrannical empire. The god might revoke a blessing \nif a character fails to pursue that purpose or acts \ncounter to it. \nA character retains the benefits of a blessing forever or \nuntil it is taken away by the god who granted it. Unlike \na magic item, such a blessing can\'t be suppressed by an \nanti magic field or similar effect. \nMost adventurers go their entire lives without \nreceiving even one of these blessings. There is no limit \non the number of blessings a character can receive, \nbut it should be rare for a character to have more than \none at a time. Moreover, a character can\'t benefit from \nmultiple instances of a blessing at the same time. For / \nexample, a character can\'t benefit from two instances,s&gt;f \nthe Blessing of Health at once. \nExample blessings are provided below. The text of a \nblessing addresses its user. If you decide to create more \nblessings, consider this: a typical blessing mimics the \nproperties of a wondrous item. \nBlessing of Health. Your Constitution score increases \nby 2, up to a maximum of 22. \nBlessing of Protection. You gain a +1 bonus to AC \nand saving throws. \nBlessing of Magic Resistance. You have advantage on \nsaving throws against spells and other magical effects. \nBlessing of Understanding. Your Wisdom score \nincreases by 2, up to a maximum of 22. \nBlessing ofValhaJJa. This blessing grants you the \npower to summon spirit warriors, as if you had blown a \nsilver horn of Valhalla. Once you use this blessing, you \ncan\'t use it again until 7 days have passed. \nBlessing of Weapon Enhancement. One nonmagical \nweapon in your possession becomes a +1 weapon \nwhenever you wield it. \nBlessing of Wound Closure. This blessing grants you \nthe benefits of a periapt of wound closure. \nCHARMS \nA charm is a minor supernatural gift, which can \nbe received in a large variety of ways. For example, \na wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a dead \narch mage\'s spellbook might be infused with the magic \nof a charm, as might a character who solves a sphinx\'s \nriddle or drinks from a magic fountain. Legendary \ncreatures, such as ancient gold dragons and unicorns, \nsometimes grace their allies with charms, and some \nexplorers find themselves bearing the magic of a charm \nafter discovering a long-lost location that is drenched in \nprimeval magic. \nSome charms can be used only once, and others can \nbe used a specific number of times before vanishing. If a \ncharm lets you cast a spell, you are able to do so without \nspending a spell slot or providing any components \n(verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a charm can\'t \nbe used in the area created by an antimagic field or a \nsimilar effect, and a charm\'s effects are susceptible to \ndispel magic and the like. But the charm itself can\'t be \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \nremoved from a creature by anything short of divine \nintervention or the wish spell. \nExample charms are provided below. The text of a \ncharm addresses its user. A typical charm mimics the \neffects of a potion or a spell, so it is easy to create more \ncharms of your own, if you like. \nCharm of Animal Conjuring. This charm allows \nyou to cast the conjure animals spell (3rd-level version \nas an action. Once used three times, the charm \nvanishes from you. \nCharm ofDarkvision. This charm allows you to \ncast the darkvision spell as an action, no components \nrequired. Once used three times, the charm goes awa_ \nCharm of Feather FaJJing. This charm grants you --\nbenefits of a ring of feather falling. These benefits last \nfor 10 days, after which the charm vanishes from you. \nCharm of Heroism. This charm allows you to give \nyourself the benefit of a potion of heroism as an action. \nOnce you do so, the charm vanishes from you. \nCharm of Restoration. This charm has 6 charges. \nYou can use an action to expend some of its charges \nto cast one of the following spells: greater restoration \n(4 charges) or Jesser restoration (2 charges). Once \nall its charges have been expended, the charm \nvanishes from you. \nCharm of the Slayer. One sword in your possession \nbecomes a dragon slayer or giant slayer (DM\'s choice) \nfor the next 9 days. The charm then vanishes from you \nand the weapon returns to normal. \nCharm of Vitality. This charm allows you to give \nyourself the benefit of a potion of vitality as an action. \nOnce you do so, the charm vanishes from you. \nMARKS OF PRESTIGE \nSometimes the most memorable reward for adventure~ \nis the prestige that they acquire throughout a realm. \nTheir adventures often earn them fame and power, \nallies and enemies, and titles that they can pass on to \ntheir descendants. Some lords and ladies began as \ncommoners who ventured into the dangerous places oi \nthe world and made names for themselves through the -\nbrave deeds. \nThis section details the most common marks of \nprestige that adventures might acquire during a \ncampaign. These marks are usually gained along with \ntreasure, but sometimes they stand on their own. \nLETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION \nWhen gold is in short supply, the adventurers\' \nbenefactor might provide them with a letter of \nrecommendation instead of monetary payment. Such a \nletter is usually enclosed in a handsome folio, case, or \nscroll tube for safe transport, and it usually bears the \nsignature and seal of whoever wrote it. \nA letter of recommendation from a person of \nimpeccable reputation can grant adventurers access \nto NPCs that they would otherwise have trouble \nmeeting on their own, such as a duke, viceroy, or queen. \nMoreover, carrying such a recommendation on one\'s \nperson can help clear up "misunderstandings" with \nlocal authorities who might not otherwise take the \nadventurers at their word. \n'},

  'text': "A letter of recommendation is worth only as much as \nthe person who wrote it and offer no benefit in places \nwhere its writer holds no sway. \nMEDALS \nAlthough they are often fash ioned from gold and \nother precious materials, medals have an even greater \nsymbolic value to those who award and receive them. \nMedals are typically awarded by powerful political \nfigures for acts of heroism, and wearing a medal \nis usually enough to earn the respect of those who \nunderstand its significance. \nDifferent acts of heroism can warrant different \nkinds of medals. The King of Breland (in the Eberron \ncampaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor \n(shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum) \nto adventurers for defending Brei ish citizens, while \nthe Golden Bear of Breland (a medal made of gold and \nshaped in a likeness of a bear's head, with gems for \neyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their \nallegiance to the Brelish Crown by uncovering and \ndefeating a plot to end the Treaty of Thronehold and \nreignite the Last War. \nA medal doesn't offer a specific in-game benefit to one \nwho wears it, but it can affect dealings with NPCs. For \nexample, a character who proudly displays the Golden \nBear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people \nwithin the kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the \nmedal carries far less weight, except among allies of \nBreland's king. \nPARCELS OF LAND \nA parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a \nroyal letter affirming that the land has been granted as a \nreward for some service. Such land usually remains the \nproperty of the local ruler or ruling body, but is leased \nto a character with the understanding that it can be \ntaken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called \ninto question. \nA parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one or \nmore farms or villages on it already, in which case the \nrecipient is pronounced lord or lady of the land and is \nexpected to collect taxes, along with any other duties. \nA character who receives a parcel of land is free to \nbuild on it and is expected to safeguard it. He or she may \nyield the land as part of an inheritance, but can't sell \nor trade it without permission from the local ruler or \nruling body. \nParcels of land make fine rewards for adventurers \nwho are looking for a place to settle or who have family \nor some kind of personal investment in the region where \nthe land is located. \nSPECIAL FAVORS \nA reward might come in the form of a favor that the \ncharacters can call on at some future date. Special \nfavors work best when the individual granting them is \ntrustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will \ndo whatever can be done to fulfill an obligation when \nthe time comes, short of breaking laws.

For example, \ncharacters might be granted special rights to carry \nweapons in public places, kill enemies of the crown, or \nnegotiate on a duke\'s behalf. They might earn the right \nto demand free room and board from any establishment \nwithin a particular community, or have the right to draft \nlocal militia to assist them as needed. \nSpecial rights last only as long as the legal document \ndictates, and such rights can be revoked if the \nadventurers abuse them. \nSTRONGHOLDS \nA stronghold is a reward usually given to seasoned \nadventurers who demonstrate unwavering fealty to a" \npowerful political figure or ruling body, such as a king, \na knighthood, or a council of wizards. A stronghold \ncan be anything from a fortified tower in the heart of \na city to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While \nthe stronghold is for the characters to govern as they \nsee fit, the land on which it sits remains the property of \nthe crown or local ruler. Should the characters prove \ndisloyal or unworthy of the gift, they can be asked or \nforced to relinquish custody of the stronghold. \nCHAPTER 7 I TREASURE \nAs an additional reward, the individual bequeathing \nthe stronghold might offer to pay its maintenance cost \nfor a period of one or more months, after which the \ncharacters inherit that responsibility. See chapter 6 for \nmore information on stronghold maintenance. \nTITLES \nA politically powerful figure has the ability to dispense \ntitles. A title often comes with a parcel of land (see \nabove). For example, a character might be awarded the \ntitle Earl of Storm river or Countess of Dun Fjord, along \nwith a parcel of land that includes a settlement or region \nof the same name. \nA character can hold more than one title, and in a \nfeudal society, those titles can be passed down to (or \ndistributed among) one\'s children. While a character \nholds a title, he or she is expected to act in a manner \nbefitting that title. By decree, titles can be stripped away \nif the local ruler or ruling body has reason to question \nthe character\'s loyalty or competence. \nALTERNATIVES TO EPIC BOONS \nYou might decide to grant one of the following rewards to a \n20th-level character, instead of awarding an epic boon. These \ntwo options can be awarded to a character more than once. \nAbility Score Improvement. The character can increase one \nability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by l each. \nThe ability score can now be increased above 20, up to a \nmaximum of 30. \nNew Feat.

  'text': "TRAINING \nA character might be offered pecial training in lieu of \na financial reward. This kind of training isn't widely \navailable and thus is highly desirable. It presumes \nthe existence of a skilled trainer-perhaps a retired \nadventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a \nmentor. The trainer might be a reclusive wizard or \nhaughty sorcerer who owes the queen a favor, the \nknight-commander of the King's Guard, the leader of \na powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a \nremote mountaintop pagoda, a barbarian chieftain, a \nwarlock living among nomads as a fortune-teller, or an \nabsentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known \nthroughout the land. \nA character who agrees to training as a reward must \nspend downtime with the trainer (see chapter 6 for \nmore information on downtime activities). In exchange, \nthe character is guaranteed to receive a special benefit. \nPossible training benefits include the following: \nThe character gains inspiration daily at dawn for \nld4 + 6 days. \n• The character gains proficiency in a skill. \nThe character gains a feat. \nEPIC BOONS \nAn epic boon is a special power available only to 20th \nlevel characters. Characters at that level gain such \nboons only if you want them to and only when you feel \nit's appropriate. Epic boons are best awarded after \nthe characters complete a major quest, or accomplish \nsomething else particularly notable. A character might \ngain an epic boon after destroying an evil artifact, \ndefeating an ancient dragon, or halting an incursion \nfrom the Outer Planes. \nEpic boons can also be used as a form of \nadvancement, a way to provide greater power to \ncharacters who have no more levels to gain. With this \napproach, consider awarding one epic boon to each \ncharacter for every 30,000 XP he or she earns above \n355,000 XP. \nYou determine which epic boon a character gains. \nIdeally, the boon you pick is something the character \nwould put to use in future adventures. You can allow a \nplayer to select a boon for his or her character, subject to \nyour approval. \nWhatever boon a character ends up with, consider its \nplace in your story and world. Many of the boons are \nextraordinary and represent the gradual transformation \nof a character into something resembling a demigod. \nThe acquisition of a boon might visibly transform a \ncharacter. For example, the eyes of a character with \nthe Boon of True sight might glow when he or she feels \nstrong emotion, and a character who has the Boon of \nHigh Magic might have faint motes of light glimmering \naround his or her head. Also, decide how the boon first \nappears. Does the boon appear spontaneously and \nmysteriously? Or does a being of cosmic power manifest \nto bestow it? The bestowal of a boon can itself be an \nexciting scene in an adventure. \nThe text of a boon addresses its user. Unless a boon \nsays otherwise, a character can't gain it more than once. \n• \n•• \n• \n"},

  'text': 'CHAPTER 8: RUNNING THE GAME \nULES ENABLE YOU AND YOUR PLAYERS TO HAVE \nfun at the table. The rules serve you, not vice \nversa. There are the rules of the game, and \nthere are table rules for how the game is \nplayed. For instance, players need to know \nwhat happens when one of them misses a \nsession. They need to know whether to bring \nminiatures, any special rules you\'ve decided to use, and \nhow to treat a cocked die (a die that lands so that its \nface can\'t be clearly read). These topics and more are \ncovered in this chapter. \nTABLE RULES \nIdeally, players come to the gaming table with the same \ngoal: to have a fun time together. This section gives \nrecommendations for table rules you can establish to \nhelp meet that goal. Here are some fundamentals: \nFoster respect. Don\'t bring personal conflicts to the \ntable or let disagreements escalate into bad feelings. \nDon\'t touch others\' dice if they\'re sensitive about it. \nAvoid distractions. Turn off the television and video \ngames. If you have young children, hire a babysitter. \nReducing distractions helps players stay in character \nand enjoy the story. It might be fine to have players \nwandering away from the table and back, but some \nplayers prefer planned breaks. \nHave snacks. Decide before a session who will bring \nfood and drink. This is often something the players \ncan handle. \nTABLE TALK \nSet expectations about how players talk at the table: \nMake it clear who\'s speaking: the character or the \nplayer (out of character). \nDecide how you feel about a player sharing \ninformation that his or her character wouldn\'t know or \nthat the character is incapable of sharing as a result of \nbeing unconscious, dead, or far away. \nAre you all right with players retracting what they just \nsaid their characters did? \nDICE ROLLING \nEstablish expectations about rolling dice. Rolling in full \nview of everyone is a good starting point. If you see a \nplayer rolling and scooping the dice up before anyone \nelse can see, encourage that player to be less secretive. \nWhen a die falls on the floor, do you count it or reroll \nit? When it lands cocked against a book, do you pull the \nbook away and see where it lands, or re~;oll it? \nWhat about you, the DM? Do you make your rolls in \nthe open or hide them behind a DM screen? Consider \nthe following: \nIf you roll dice where the players can see, they know \nyou\'re playing impartially and not fudging rolls. \nRolling behind a screen keeps the players guessing \nabout the strength of their opposition. When a \nmonster hits all the time, is it of a much higher level \nthan the characters, or are you rolling high numbers? \nRolling behind a screen lets you fudge the results if \nyou want to. If two critical hits in a row would kill a \ncharacter, you could change the second critical hit \ninto a normal hit, or even a miss. Don\'t distort die rolls \ntoo often, though, and don\'t let on that you\'re doing it. \nOtherwise, your players might think they don\'t face \nany real risks-or worse, that you\'re playing favorites. \nA roll behind a screen can help preserve mystery. For \nexample, if a player thinks there might be someone \ninvisible nearby and makes a Wisdom (Perception) \ncheck, consider rolling a die behind the screen even if \nno one is there, making the player think someone is, \nindeed, hiding. Try not to overuse this trick. \nYou might choose to make a roll for a player because \nyou don\'t want the player to know how good the check \ntotal is. For example, if a player suspects a baroness \nmight be charmed and wants to make a Wisdom \n(Insight) check, you could make the roll in secret for \nthe player. If the player rolled and got a high number \nbut didn\'t sense anything amiss, the player would be \nconfident that the baroness wasn\'t charmed. With a \nlow roll, a negative answer wouldn\'t mean much. A \nhidden roll allows uncertainty. \nROLLING ATTACKS AND DAMAGE \nPlayers are accustomed to rolling an attack roll first \nand then a damage roll. If players make attack rolls and \ndamage rolls at the same time, the action moves a little \nfaster around the table. \nRULES DISCUSSIONS \nYou might need to set a policy on rules discussions at \nthe table. Some groups don\'t mind putting the game \non hold while they hash out different interpretations \nof a rule. Others prefer to let the DM make a call and \ncontinue with the action. If you gloss over a rules issue \nin play, make a note of it (a good task to delegate to a \nplayer) and return to the issue later. \nMETAGAME THINKING \nMetagame thinking means thinking about the game as \na game. It\'s like when a character in a movie knows it\'s a \nmovie and acts accordingly. For example, a player might \nsay, "The DM wouldn\'t throw such a powerful monster \nat us!" or you might hear, "The read-aloud text spent a \nlot of time describing that door- let\'s search it again!" \nDiscourage metagame thinking by giving players a \ngentle reminder: "What do your characters think?" You \ncan curb metagame thinking by setting up situations \nthat will be difficult for the characters and that might \nrequire negotiation or retreat to survive. \nMISSING PLAYERS \nHow should you deal with the characters of missing \nplayers? Consider these options: \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNN lNG THE GAME \n'},

On returning, the player \nresumes playing as if he or she was never gone. \nSMALL GROUPS \nMost of the time, each player runs one character. \nThe game plays best that way, without overwhelming \nanyone. But if your group is small, players can control \nmore than one character. Or you can fill out the group \nwith NPC followers, using the guidelines in chapter 4, \n"Creating Nonplayer Characters." You can also make \nthe characters more resilient by using the healing surge \noption in chapter 9, "Dungeon Master\'s Workshop." \nDon\'t force a reluctant player to take on multiple \ncharacters, and don\'t show favoritism by allowing only \none player to do so. If one character is the mentor of \nthe other, the player can focus on roleplaying just one \ncharacter. Otherwise, players can end up awkwardly \ntalking to themselves in character, or avoiding \nroleplaying altogether. \nMultiple characters can be a good idea in a game \nthat features nonstop peril and a high rate of character \ndeath. If your group agrees to the premise, have each \nplayer keep one or two additional characters on hand, \nready to jump in whenever the current character dies. \nEach time the main character gains a level, the backup \ncharacters do as well. \nNEW PLAYERS ------\nWhen a new player joins the group, allow the new \nplayer to create a character of a level equal to the \nlowest-level member of the party. The only exception \nto this guideline is when the new player is completely \nunfamiliar with the D&amp;D game. In that case, have that \nplayer start with a 1st-level character. If the rest of tlie \nparty is significantly higher in level, consider taking a \nshort break from the campaign and having everyone \nplay a 1st-level character for a few sessions while the \nnew player learns the ropes. \nIntegrating a new character into the group can be \ndifficult if the party is in the middle of an adventure. The \nfollowing approaches can help make it easier: \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE. GAME \nThe new character is a friend or relative of one of the \nadventurers who has been searching for the group. \n• The new character is a prisoner of the foes the other \ncharacters are fighting. When rescued, this character \njoins their group. \nThe new character is the sole survivor of another \nadventuring group. \nTHE ROLE OF DICE \nDice are neutral arbiters. They can determine the \noutcome of an action without assigning any motivation \nto the DM and without playing favorites. The extent to \nwhich you use them is entirely up to you. \nROLLING WITH IT \nSome DMs rely on die rolls for almost everything. Whe \na character attempts a task, the DM calls for a check a \npicks a DC. As a DM using this style, you can\'t rely on \nthe characters succeeding or failing on any one check \nto move the action in a specific direction. You must be \nready to improvise and react to a changing situation. \nRelying on dice also gives the players the sense that \nanything is possible. Sure, it might seem unlikely that \nthe party\'s hal fling can leap on the ogre\'s back, pull a \nsack over its head, and then dive to safety, but with a \nlucky enough roll it just might work. \nA drawback of this approach is that roleplaying \ncan diminish if players feel that their die rolls, rather \nthan their decisions and characterizations, always \ndetermine success. \nIGNORING THE DICE \nOne approach is to use dice as rarely as possible. Some \nDMs use them only during combat, and determine \nsuccess or failure as they like in other situations. \nWith this approach, the DM decides whether an action \nor a plan succeeds or fails based on how well the player: \nmake their case, how thorough or creative they are, or \nother factors. For example, the players might describe \nhow they search for a secret door, detailing how they \ntap on a wall or twist a torch sconce to find its trigger. \nThat could be enough to convince the DM that they \nfind the secret door without having to make an ability \ncheck to do so. \nThis approach rewards creativity by encouraging \nplayers to look to the situation you\'ve described for an \nanswer, rather than looking to their character sheet or \ntheir character\'s special abilities. A downside is that no \nDM is completely neutral. ADM might come to favor \ncertain players or approaches, or even work against \ngood ideas if they send the game in a direction he or she \ndoesn\'t like. This approach can also slow the game if the \nDM focuses on one "correct" action that the characters \nmust describe to overcome an obstacle. \nTHE MIDDLE PATH \nMany DMs find that using a combination of the two \napproaches works best. By balancing the use of dice \nagainst deciding on success, you can encourage your \nplayers to strike a balance between relying on their \n'},

  'text': "bonuses and abilities and paying attention \nto the game and immersing themselves in \nits world. \nRemember that dice don't run your \ngame- you do. Dice are like rules. They're \ntools to help keep the action moving. At any \ntime, you can decide that a player's action is \nautomatically successful. You can also grant \nthe player advantage on any ability check, \nreducing the chance of a bad die roll foiling the \ncharacter's plans. By the same token, a bad plan \nor unfortunate circumstances can transform the \neasiest task into an impossibility, or at least impose \ndisadvantage. \nUSING ABILITY SCORES \nWhen a player wants to do something, it's often \nappropriate to let the attempt succeed without a roll \nor a reference to the character's ability scores. For \nexample, a character doesn't normally need to make \na Dexterity check to walk across an empty room or a \nCharisma check to order a mug of ale. Only call for a \nroll if there is a meaningful consequence for failure. \nWhen deciding whether to use a roll, ask yourself two \nquestions: \nIs a task so easy and so free of conflict and stress that \nthere should be no chance of failure? \nIs a task so inappropriate or impossible- such as \nhitting the moon with an arrow-that it can't work? \nIf the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind \nof roll is appropriate. The following sections provide \nguidance on determining whether to call for an ability \ncheck, attack roll, or saving throw; how to assign DCs; \nwhen to use advantage and disadvantage; and other \nrelated topics. \nABILITY CHECKS \nAn ability check is a test to see whether a character \nsucceeds at a task that he or she has decided to attempt. \nThe Player's Handbook includes examples of what \neach ability score is used for. The Ability Checks table \nsummarizes that material for easy reference. \nMULTIPLE ABILITY CHECKS \nSometimes a character fails an ability check and \nwants to try again. In some cases, a character is free \nto do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With \nenough attempts and enough time, a character should \n~ ABILITY CHECKS \nAbility \nUsed for... \nExample Uses \neventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, \nassume that a character spending ten times the normal \namount of time needed to complete a task automatically \nsucceeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating \nthe check allows a character to turn an impossible task \ninto a successful one. \nIn other cases, failing an ability check makes it \nimpossible to make the same check to do the same thing \nagain. For example, a rogue might try to trick a town \nguard into thinking the adventurers are undercover \nagents of the king. If the rogue loses a contest of \nCharisma (Deception) against the guard's Wisdom \n(Insight), the same lie told again won't work. The \ncharacters can come up with a different way to get past \nthe guard or try the check again against another guard \nat a different gate.

  'text': 'CONTESTS \nA contest is a kind of ability check that matches \ntwo creatures against each other. Use a contest if a \ncharacter attempts something that either directly foils \nor is directly opposed by another creature\'s efforts. In a \ncontest, the ability checks are compared to each other, \nrather than to a target number. \nWhen you call for a contest, you pick the ability that \neach side must use, deciding whether both sides use the \nsame ability or whether different abilities should counter \neach other. For example, when a creature tries to hide, it \nengages in a contest of Dexterity against Wisdom. But if \ntwo creatures arm wrestle, or if one creature is holding \na door closed against another\'s attempt to push it open, \nboth use Strength. \nSAVING THROWS \nAbility \nUsed For ... \nStrength \nOpposing a force that would physically move \nor bind you \nDexterity \nDodging out of harm\'s way \nConstitution \nEnduring a disease, poison, or other hazard \nthat saps vitality \nIntelligence \nDisbelieving certain illusions and resisting \nmental assaults that can be refuted with logic. \nsharp memory, or both \nWisdom \nResisting effects that charm, frighten, or \notherwise assault your willpower \nCharisma \nWithstanding effects, such as possession, \nthat would subsume your personality or hu rl \nATTACK ROLLS \nyou to another plane of existence \n-----\n------------\nCall for an attack roll when a character tries to hit a \ncreature or an object with an attack, especially when \nthe attack could be foiled by the target\'s armor or shield \nor by another object providing cover. You can also use \nattack rolls to resolve noncombat activities such as \narchery contests or a game of darts. \nSAVING THROWS \nA saving throw is an instant response to a harmful effect \nand is almost never done by choice. A save makes the \nmost sense when something bad happens to a character \nand the character has a chance to avoid that effect. An \nability check is something a character actively attempts \nto accomplish, whereas a saving throw is a split-second \nresponse to the activity of someone or something else. \nMost of the time, a saving throw comes into play when \nan effect-such as a spell, monster ability, or trap-calls \nfor it, telling you what kind of saving throw is involved \nand providing a DC for it. \nOther times, a situation arises that clearly calls for a \nsaving throw, especially when a character is subjected \nto a harmful effect that can\'t be hedged out by armor or \na shield. It\'s up to you to decide which ability score is \ninvolved. The Saving Throws table offers suggestions. \nINTELLIGENCE CHECK VS. WISDOM CHECK \nIf you have trouble deciding whether to call for an Intelli-\ngence or a Wisdom check to determine whether a character \nnotices something, think of it in terms of what a very high or \nlow score in those two abilities might mean. \nA character with a high Wisdom but low Intelligence is \naware of the surroundings but is bad at interpreting what \nthings mean. The character might spot that one section of \na wall is clean and dusty compared to the others, but he or \nshe wouldn\'t necessarily make the deduction that a secret \ndoor is there. \nIn contrast, a character with high Intelligence and low \nWisdom is probably oblivious but clever. The character might \nnot spot the clean section of wall but, if asked about it, could \nimmediately deduce why it\'s clean. \nWisdom checks allow characters to perceive what is \naround them (the wall is clean here), while Intelligence \nchecks answer why things are that way (there\'s probably a \nsecret door). \n""" \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME \nDIFFICULTY CLASS \nIt\'s your job to establish the Difficulty Class for an abili _ \ncheck or a saving throw when a rule or an adventure \ndoesn\'t give you one. Sometimes you\'ll even want to \nchange such established DCs. When you do so, think o: \nhow difficult a task is and then pick the associated DC \nfrom the Typical DCs table. \nTYPICAL DCs \nTask \nDC \nTask \nDC \nVery easy \n5 \nHard \n20 \nEasy \n10 \nVery hard \n25 \nModerate \n15 \nNearly impossible \n30 \nThe numbers associated with these categories of \ndifficulty are meant to be easy to keep in your head, \nso that you don\'t have to refer to this book every time \nyou decide on a DC. Here are some tips for using DC \ncategories at.the gaming table. \nIf you\'ve decided that an ability check is called for, \nthen most likely the task at hand isn\'t a very easy \none. Most people can accomplish a DC 5 task with \nlittle chance of failure. Unless circumstances are \nunusual, let characters succeed at such a task without \nmaking a check. \nThen ask yourself, "Is this task\'s difficulty easy, \nmoderate, or hard?" If the only DCs you ever use are 1C \n15, and 20, your game will run just fine. Keep in mind \nthat a character with a 10 in the associated ability and \nno proficiency will succeed at an easy task around 50 \npercent of the time. A moderate task requires a higher \nscore or proficiency for success, whereas a hard task \ntypically requires both. A big dose of luck with the d20 \nalso doesn\'t hurt. \nIf you find yourself thinking, "This task is especially \nhard," you can use a higher DC, but do so with caution \nand consider the level of the characters. A DC 25 task \nis very hard for low-level characters to accomplish, bu-\nit becomes more reasonable after lOth level or so. A \nDC 30 check is nearly impossible for most low-level \ncharacters. A 20th-level character with proficiency and -\nrelevant ability score of 20 still needs a 19 or 20 on the \ndie roll to succeed at a task of this difficulty. \n'},

  'text': "VARIANT: AUTOMATIC SUCCESS \nSometimes the randomness of a d20 roll leads to \nludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a successful \nDC 15 Strength check to be battered down. A fighter \nwith a Strength of 20 might helplessly flail against the \ndoor because of bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with \na Strength of 10 rolls a 20 and knocks the door from \nits hinges. \nIf such results bother you, consider allowing \nautomatic success on certain checks. Under this \noptional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any \nability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant \nability score minus 5. So in the example above, the \nfighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule \ndoesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls. \nHaving proficiency with a skill or tool can also \ngrant automatic success. If a character's proficiency \nbonus applies to his or her ability check, the character \nautomatically succeeds if the DC is 10 or less. If that \ncharacter is 11th level or higher, the check succeeds if \nthe DC is 15 or less. \nThe downside of this whole approach is its \npredictability. For example, once a character's ability \nscore reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that \nability become automatic successes. Smart players \nwill then always match the character with the highest \nability score against any given check. If you want some \nrisk of failure, you need to set higher DCs. Doing this, \nthough, can aggravate the problem you're trying to solve: \nhigher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even \nmore on luck. \nPROFICIENCY \nWhen you ask a player to make an ability check, \nconsider whether a skill or tool proficiency might apply \nto it. The player might also ask you if a particular \nproficiency applies. \nOne way to think about this question is to consider \nwhether a character could become better at a particular \ntask through training and practice. If the answer is \nno, it's fine to say that no proficiency applies. But if \nthe answer is yes, assign an appropriate skill or tool \nproficiency to reflect that training and practice. \nSKILLS \nAs described in the Player's Handbook, a skill \nproficiency represents a character's focus on one \naspect of an ability. Among all the things a character's \nDexterity score describes, the character might be \nparticularly skilled at sneaking around, reflected in \nproficiency in the Stealth skill. When that skill is used \nfor an ability check, it is usually used with Dexterity. \nUnder certain circumstances, you can decide a \ncharacter's proficiency in a skill can be applied to a \ndifferent ability check. For example, you might decide \nthat a character forced to swim from an island to the \nmainland must succeed on a Constitution check (as \nopposed to a Strength check) because of the distance \ninvolved. The character is proficient in the Athletics \nskill, which covers swimming, so you allow the \ncharacter's proficiency bonus to apply to this ability \ncheck. In effect, you're asking for a Constitution \n(Athletics) check, instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. \nOften, players ask whether they can apply a skill \nproficiency to an ability check. If a player can provide \na good justification for why a character's training and \naptitude in a skill should apply to the check, go ahead \nand allow it, rewarding the player's creative thinking. \nTOOLS \nHaving proficiency with a tool allows you to apply \nyour proficiency bonus to an ability check you make \nusing that tool. For example, a character proficient \nwith carpenter's tools can apply his or her proficiency \nbon.us to a Dexterity check to craft a wooden flute, an \nIntelligence check to craft a wooden secret door, or a \nStrength check to build a working trebuchet. However, \nthe proficiency bonus wouldn't apply to an ability check \nmade to identify unsafe wooden construction or to \ndiscern the origin of a crafted item, since neither check \nrequires tool use. \nSAVING THROWS AND ATTACK ROLLS \nCharacters are either proficient with a saving throw \nor attack, or they aren't. The bonus always applies if a \ncharacter is proficient. \nADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE \nAdvantage and disadvantage are among the most useful \ntools in your DM's toolbox. They reflect temporary \ncircumstances that might affect the chances of a \ncharacter succeeding or failing at a task. Advantage \nis also a great way to reward a player who shows \nexceptional creativity in play. \nCharacters often gain advantage or disadvantage \nthrough the use of special abilities, actions, spells, or \nother features of their classes or backgrounds. In other \ncases, you decide whether a circumstance influences a \nroll in one direction or another, and you grant advantage \nor impose disadvantage as a result. \nConsider granting advantage when 000 \nCircumstances not related to a creature's inherent \ncapabilities provide it with an edge. \nSome aspect of the environment contributes to the \ncharacter's chance of success. \n• A player shows exceptional creativity or cunning in \nattempting or describing a task. \n• Previous actions (whether taken by the character \nmaking the attempt or some other creature) improve \nthe chances of success. \nConsider imposing disadvantage when 000 \n• Circumstances hinder success in some way. \n• Some aspect of the environment makes success less \nlikely (assuming that aspect doesn't already impose a \npenalty to the roll being made). \n• An element of the plan or description of an action \nmakes success less likely. \nBecause advantage and disadvantage cancel each \nother out, there's no need to keep track of how many \ncircumstances weigh on both sides. \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME \n"},

  'text': "For example, imagine a wizard is running down a \ndungeon cor~idor to escape from a beholder. Around \nthe corner ahead, two ogres lie in wait. Does the wizard \nhear the ogres readying their ambush? You look at \nthe wizard's passive Wisdom (Perception) score and \nconsider all the factors weighing on it. \nThe wizard is running, not paying attention to what's \nahead of him. This imposes disadvantage on the \nwizard's ability check. However, the ogres are readying \na portcullis trap and making a lot of noise with a winch, \nwhich could grant the wizard advantage on the check. \nAs a result, the character has neither advantage nor \ndisadvantage on the Wisdom check, and you don't need \nto consider any additional factors. Past encounters with \nan ogre ambush, the fact that the wizard's ears are \nstill ringing from the thunderwave spell he cast at the \nbeholder, the overall noise level of the dungeon- none of \nthat matters any more. They all cancel out. \nINSPIRATION \nAwarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage \nroleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the Player's \nHandbook, having inspiration gives a character an \nobvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one \nability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember \nthat a character can have no more than one inspiration \nat a time. \nAWARDING INSPIRATION \nThink of inspiration as a spice that you can use to \nenhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using \ninspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of \nthe game. If you take away anything from this section, \nremember this golden rule: inspiration should make the \ngame more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration \nwhen players take actions that make the game more \nexciting, amusing, or memorable. \nAs a rule of thumb, aim to award inspiration to each \ncharacter about once per session of play. Over time, you \nmight want to award inspiration more or less often, at \na rate that works best for your table. You might use the \nsame rate for your entire DMing career, or you might \nchange it with each campaign. \nOffering inspiration as a reward encourages certain \ntypes of behavior in your players. Think of your style as \na DM and your group's preferences. What helps make \nthe game more fun for your group? What type of action \nfit in with your campaign's style or genre? Your answer \nto those questions help determine when you award \ninspiration. \nRoleplaying. Using inspiration to reward roleplaying \nis a good place to start for most groups. Reward a \nplayer with inspiration when that player causes his or \nher character to do something that is consistent with \nthe character's personality trait, flaw, or bond. The \ncharacter's action should be notable in some way. It \nmight drive the story forward, push the adventurers into \ndanger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence. \nyou reward the player for roleplaying in a way that \nmakes the game more enjoyable for everyone else. \nTake into account each player's roleplaying style, and \ntry not to favor one style over another. For example, \nAllison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and \nadopting her character's mannerisms, but Paul feels \nself-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe \nhis character ~s attitude and actions. Neither style is \nbetter than the other. Inspiration encourages players to \ntake part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly \nmakes the game better for everyone. \nHeroism. You can use inspiration to encourage \nplayer characters to take risks. A fighter might not \nnormally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the mid \nof a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the \ncharacter's daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a \nreward tells the players that you want them to embrace \nswashbuckling action. \nThis approach is great for campaigns that emphasize \naction-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider \nallowing inspiration to be spent after a d20 roll, rather \nthan before. This approach turns inspiration into a \ncushion against failure-and a guarantee that it comes \ninto play only when a player is faced directly by failure. \nSuch an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting. \nA Reward for Victory. Some DMs prefer to play an \nimpartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally \nrequires a DM's judgment to award, which might \nrun against your style if you like a campaign where \nyou let dice determine most outcomes. If that's your \n"},

  'text': 'style, consider using inspiration as a reward when \nthe characters achieve an important goal or victory, \nrepresenting a surge of confidence and energy. \nUnder this model, give everyone in the party \ninspiration if the characters manage to defeat a \npowerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a \ngoal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in \nthe campaign. \nGenre Emulation. Inspiration is a handy tool for \nreinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. \nUnder this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as \npersonality traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any \nof the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired \nby film noir, characters could have an additional flaw: \n"I can\'t resist helping a person I find alluring despite \nwarnings that he or she is nothing but trouble." If the \ncharacters agree to help a suspicious but seductive \nnoble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue \nand betrayal, reward them with inspiration. \nSimilarly, characters in a horror story typically can\'t \nhelp but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its \nsecrets. They probably also go off alone when they \nshouldn\'t. If the party splits up, consid~r giving each \ncharacter inspiration. \nA sensible person would avoid the noble\'s intrigues \nand the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, \nwe\'re not dealing with sensible people; we\'re dealing \nwith protagonists in a particular type of story. For this \napproach to work, create a list of your genre\'s main \nconventions and share it with your players. Before the \ncampaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your \ngroup is on board for embracing those conventions. \nPlayers and Inspiration. Remember that a player \nwith inspiration can award it to another player. Some \ngroups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, \ndeciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It\'s \nbest to let players award their inspiration as they see \nfit, but feel free to talk to them about following certain \nguidelines, particularly if you\'re trying to reinforce \nconventions of a certain genre. \nW HEN Do You AwARD INSPIRATION? \nConsider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some \nDMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. \nOther DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering \ninspiration while a player is considering options. Both \napproaches have their strengths and weaknesses. \nWaiting until after an action preserves the flow of \nplay, but it also means players don\'t know whether their \ndecisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the \nplayer can\'t spend the inspiration on the act that earned \nit, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it \nor are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This \napproach works best for groups that want to focus on \nimmersion and player agency, where the DM steps \nback and gives the players more freedom to do what \nthey want. \nTelling a player that an action will earn inspiration \nprovides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are \nmanipulating the players or making choices for them. \nOffering inspiration before an action works great with \ngroups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre \nemulation and group storytelling, where character \nfreedom isn\'t as important as weaving a compelling \ntale together. \nStart with awarding inspiration after an action, \nespecially for your first campaign or when playing with \na new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the \nflow of play and avoids making the players feel as if you \nare being manipulative. \nTRACKING INSPIRATION \nA player typically notes on a character sheet whether \nhe or she has inspiration, or you can use poker chips or \nsome other token Alternatively, you can hand out special \nd20s to represent inspiration. When a player spends \ninspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it \nback to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to \nsomeone else, the d20 can go to that other person. \nIGNORING INSPIRATION \nInspiration might not work for your campaign. Some \nDMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and \nothers feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts \nof the game are their own rewards that don\'t need \nincentives like inspiration. \nIf you choose to ignore inspiration, you\'re telling the \nplayers that your campaign is one where you let the \ndice fall where they may. It\'s a good option for gritty \ncampaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an \nimpartial role as a rules arbiter. \nVARIANT: ONLY PLAYERS AWARD INSPIRATION \nAs a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. \nSometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget \nto award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players \nto handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every \nsession, each player can award inspiration to another \nplayer. A player follows whatever guidelines the group \nhas agreed on for awarding inspiration. \nThis approach makes your life easier and also gives \nplayers the chance to recognize each other for good \nplay. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being \nawarded fairly. \nThis approach works best with groups that are \nfocused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely \nmanipulate it to gain advantage in key situations, \nwithout earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying \nor whatever other criteria the group has established. \nIn this variant, you can allow each player to award \ninspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the \nfirst time that a player awards inspiration in a session \nis free. Whenever that player awards it later in the same \nes ion. you gain inspiration that you can spend to give \nadvantage to any foe of the player characters. There\'s \nno limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in \nthis way. and unspent inspiration carries over from one \nsession to the next. \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME \n'},

  'text': "RESOLUTION AND CONSEQUENCES \nYou determine the consequences of attack rolls, ability \nchecks, and saving throws. In most cases, doing so is \nstraightforward. When an attack hits, it deals damage. \nWhen a creature fails a saving throw, the creature \nsuffers a harmful effect. When an ability check equals or \nexceeds the DC, the check succeeds. \nAs a DM, you have a variety of flourishes and \napproaches you can take when adjudicating success and \nfailure to make things a little less black-and-white. \nSuccEss AT A CosT \nFailure can be tough, but the agony is compounded \nwhen a character fails by the barest margin. When a \ncharacter fails a roll by only 1 or 2, you can allow the \ncharacter to succeed at the cost of a complication or \nhindrance. Such complications can run along any of the \nfollowing lines: \nA character manages to get her sword past a \nhobgoblin's defenses and turn a near miss into a hit, \nbut the hobgoblin twists its shield and disarms her. \nA character narrowly escapes the full brunt of a \nfireball but ends up prone. \nA character fails to intimidate a kobold prisoner, but \nthe kobold reveals its secrets anyway while shrieking \nat the top of its lungs, alerting other nearby monsters. \n• A character manages to finish an arduous climb to the \ntop of a cliff despite slipping, only to realize that the \nrope on which his companions dangle below him is \nclose to breaking. \nWhen you introduce costs such as these, try to make \nthem obstacles and setbacks that change the nature \nof the adventuring situation. In exchange for success, \nplayers must consider new ways of facing the challenge. \nYou can also use this technique when a character \nsucceeds on a roll by hitting the DC exactly, \ncomplicating marginal success in interesting ways. \nDEGREES OF FAILURE \nSometimes a failed ability check has different \nconsequences depending on the degree of failure. For \nexample, a character who fails to disarm a trapped chest \nmight accidentally spring the trap if the check fails by \n5 or more, whereas a lesser failure means that the trap \nwasn't triggered during the botched disarm attempt. \nConsider adding similar distinctions to other checks. \nPerhaps a failed Charisma (Persuasion) check means a \nqueen won't help, whereas a failure of 5 or more means \nshe throws you ir the dungeon for your impudence. \nCRITICAL SUCCESS OR FAILURE \nRolling a 20 or a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw \ndoesn't normally have any special effect. However, \nyou can choose to take such an exceptional roll into \naccount when adjudicating the outcome. It's up to you \nto determine how this manifests in the game. An easy \napproach is to increase the impact of the success or \nfailure. For example, rolling a 1 on a failed attempt \nto pick a lock might break the thieves' tools being \nused, and rolling a 20 on a successful Intelligence \n(Investigation) check might reveal an extra clue. \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME \n• \nEXPLORATION \nThis section provides guidance for running exploration, \nespecially travel, tracking, and visibility. \nUSING A MAP \nWhatever environment the adventurers are exploring, \nyou can use a map to follow their progress as you relate \nthe details of their travels. In a dungeon, tracking \nmovement on a map lets you describe the branching \npassages, doors, chambers, and other features the \nadventurers encounter as they go, and gives the players \nthe opportunity to choose their own path. Similarly, a \nwilderness map can show roads, rivers, terrain, and \nother features that might guide the characters on their \ntravels- or lead them astray. \nThe Map Travel Pace table helps you track travel on \nmaps of different scales. The table shows how much \ndistance on a map the adventurers can cover on foot \nin minutes, hours, or days. The table uses the travel \npaces- slow, normal, and fast-described in the Player's \nHandbook. Characters moving at a normal pace can \nwalk about 24 miles in a day. \nMAP TRAVEL PACE \nMap Scale \nSlow Pace \nNormal Pace \nFast Pace \nDungeon \n20 sq.fmin. \n30 sq.fmin. \n40 sq.fmin. \n(1 sq.= 10ft.) \nCity \n2 sq.fm in. \n3 sq.fmin. \n4 sq.fmin. \n(1 sq.= 100ft.) \nProvince \n2 hexesjhr., \n3 hexesfhr., \n4 hexesjhr., \n(1 hex= 1 mi.) \n18 hexesfday \n24 hexesfday 30 hexesjday \nKingdom \n1 hexf3 hr., \n1 hexf2 hr., \n1 hexjll/2 hr., \n(1 hex= 6 mi.) \n3 hexesjday \n4 hexesfday \n5 hexesjday \nSPECIAL TRAVEL PACE \nThe rules ori travel pace in the Player's Handbook \nassume that a group of travelers adopts a pace that, over \ntime, is unaffected by the individual members' walking \nspeeds. The difference between walking speeds can \nbe significant during combat, but during an overland \njourney, the difference vanishes as travelers pause to \ncatch their breath, the faster ones wait for the slower \nones, and one traveler's quickness is matched by \nanother traveler's endurance. \nA character bestride a phantom steed, soaring \nthrough the air on a carpet of flying, or riding a sailboar \nor a steam-powered gnomish contraption doesn't travel \nat a normal rate, since the magic, engine, or wind \ndoesn't tire the way a creature does and the air doesn't \ncontain the types of obstructions found on land. When a \ncreature is traveling with a flying speed or with a speed \ngranted by magic, an engine, or a natural force (such as \nwind or a water current), translate that speed into travel \nrates using the following rules: \nIn 1 minute, you can move a number of feet equal to \nyour speed times 10. \nIn 1 hour, you can move a number of miles equal to \nyour speed divided by 10. \n"},

  'text': "For daily travel, multiply your hourly rate of travel by \nthe number of hours traveled (typically 8 hours). \nFor a fast pace, increase the rate of travel by one-third. \nFor a slow pace, multiply the rate by two-thirds. \nFor example, a character under the effect of a wind \nwalk spell gains a flying speed of 300 feet. In 1 minute, \nthe character can move 3,000 feet at a normal pace, \n4,000 feet at a fast pace, or 2,000 feet at a slow pace. \nThe character can also cover 20, 30, or 40 miles in an \nhour. The spell lasts for 8 hours, allowing the character \nto travel 160, 240, or 320 miles in a day. \nSimilarly, a phantom steed spell creates a magical \nmount with a speed of 100 feet that doesn't tire like a \nreal horse. A character on a phantom steed can cover \n1,000 feet in 1 minute at a normal pace, 1,333 feet at \na fast pace, or 666 feet at a slow pace. In 1 hour, the \ncharacter can travel 7, 10, or 13 miles. \nVISIBILITY OUTDOORS \nWhen traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2 \nmiles in any direction on a clear day, or until the point \nwhere trees, hills, or other obstructions block their view. \nRain normally cuts maximum visibility down to 1 mile, \nand fog can cut it down to between 100 and 300 feet. \nOn a clear day, the characters can see 40 miles if they \nare atop a mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able \nto look down on the area around them from a height. \nNOTICING OTHER CREATURES \nWhile exploring, characters might encounter other \ncreatures. An important question in such a situation is \nwho notices whom. \nIndoors, whether the sides can see one another \nusually depends on the configuration of rooms and \npassageways. Vision might also be limited by light \nsources. Outdoor visibility can be hampered by terrain, \nweather, and time of day. Creatures can be more likely \nto hear one another before they see anything. \nIf neither side is being stealthy, creatures \nautomatically notice each other once they are within \nsight or hearing range of one another. Otherwise, \ncompare the Dexterity (Stealth) check results of the \ncreatures in the group that is hiding with the passive \nWisdom (Perception) scores of the other group, as \nexplained in the Player's Handbook. \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME \n243 \n"},

  'text': 'TRACKING \nAdventurers sometimes choose their path by following \nthe tracks of other creatures-or other creatures might \ntrack the adventurers! To track, one or more creatures \nmust succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) check. You might \nrequire trackers to make a new check in any of the \nfollowing circumstances: \n• They stop tracking and resume after finishing a short \nor long rest. \nThe trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that \nshows no tracks. \n• The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way \nthat makes tracking harder. \nThe DC for the check depends on how well the ground \nshows signs of a creature\'s passage. No roll is necessary \nin situations where the tracks are obvious. For example, \nno check is needed to track an army advancing along \na muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is \nmore challenging, unless the creature being tracked \nleaves a distinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time \noften makes tracks harder to follow. In a situation where \nthere is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is \nimpossible. \nThe Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting \nthe DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on \nyour assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant \nadvantage on the check if there\'s more than one set \nof tracks to follow, or disadvantage if the trail being \nfollowed passes through a well-trafficked area. \nOn a failed check, the character loses the trail but can \nattempt to find it again by making a careful search of the \narea.

They want to extract information, secure aid, \nwin someone\'s trust, escape punishment, avoid combat, \nnegotiate a treaty, or achieve whatever other objective \nled to the interaction in the first place. The creatures \nthey interact with also have agendas. \nSome DMs prefer to run a social interaction as a \nfree-form roleplaying exercise, where dice rarely come \ninto play. Other DMs prefer to resolve the outcome of \nan interaction by having characters make Charisma \nchecks. Either approach works, and most games \nfall somewhere in between, balancing player skill \n(roleplaying and persuading) with character skill \n(reflected by ability checks). \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME \nRESOLVING INTERACTIONS ------\nThe Player\'s Handbook provides guidelines for \nbalancing roleplaying and ability checks in a social \ninteraction (see chapter 8, "Adventuring," in that book . \nThis section adds to that material by providing a \nstructured way to resolve a social interaction. Much of \nthis structure will be invisible to your players in play aD: \nisn\'t meant to be a substitute for roleplaying. \nl. STARTING ATTITUDE \nChoose the starting attitude of a creature the \nadventurers are interacting with: friendly, indifferent. \nor hostile. \nA friendly creature wants to help the adventurers \nand wishes for them to succeed. For tasks or actions \nthat require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly \ncreatures usually help without question. If an element \npersonal risk is involved, a successful Charisma check \nmight be required to convince a friendly creature to take \nthat risk. \nAn indifferent creature might help or hinder the \nparty, depending on what the creature sees as most \nbeneficial. A creature\'s indifference doesn\'t necessarily \nmake it standoffish or disinterested. Indifferent \ncreatures might be polite and genial, surly and irritable \nor anything in between. A successful Charisma check \nis necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an \nindifferent creature to do something. \nA hostile creature opposes the adventurers and their \ngoals but doesn\'t necessarily attack them on sight. \nFor example, a condescending noble might wish to \nsee a group of upstart adventurers fail so as to keep \nthem from becoming rivals for the king\'s attention, \nthwarting them with slander and scheming rather than \ndirect threats and violence. The adventurers need to \nsucceed on one or more challenging Charisma checks \nto convince a hostile creature to do anything on their \nbehalf. That said, a hostile creature might be so ill-\ndisposed toward the party that no Charisma check can \nimprove its attitude, in which case any attempt to sway i· \nthrough diplomacy fails automatically. \n2. CONVERSATION \nPlay out the conversation. Let the adventurers make \ntheir points, trying to frame their statements in \nterms that are meaningful to the creature they are \ninteracting with. \nChanging Attitude. The attitude of a creature \nmight change over the course of a conversation. If \nthe adventurers say or do the right things during \nan interaction (perhaps by touching on a creature\'s \nideal, bond, or flaw), they can make a hostile creature \ntemporarily indifferent, or make an indifferent creature \ntemporarily friendly. Likewise, a gaffe, insult, or harmful \ndeed might make a friendly creature temporarily \nindifferent or turn an indifferent creature hostile. \nWhether the adventurers can shift a creature\'s \nattitude is up to you. You decide whether the adventurer \nhave successfully couched their statements in terms \nthat matter to the creature. Typically, a creature\'s \nattitude can\'t shift more than one step during a single \ninteraction, whether temporarily or permanently. \n'},

  'text': "Determining Characteristics. The adventurers don't \nnecessarily enter into a social interaction with a full \nunderstanding of a creature's ideal. bond, or flaw. If they \nwant to shift a creature's attitude by playing on these \ncharacteristics, they first need to determine what the \ncreature cares about. They can guess, but doing so runs \nthe risk of shifting the creature's attitude in the wrong \ndirection if they guess badly. \nAfter interacting with a creature long enough to get \na sense of its personality traits and characteristics \nthrough conversation, an adventurer can attempt a \nWisdom (Insight) check to uncover one of the creature's \ncharacteristics. You set the DC. A check that fails by \n10 or more might misidentify a characteristic, so you \nshould provide a false characteristic or invert one of \nthe creature's existing characteristics. For example, if \nan old sage's flaw is that he is prejudiced against the \nuneducated, an adventurer who badly fails the check \nmight be told that the sage enjoys personally seeing to \nthe education of the downtrodden. \nGiven time, adventurers can also learn about a \ncreature's characteristics from other sources, including \nits friends and allies, personal letters, and publicly told \nstories. Acquiring such information might be the basis \nof an entirely different set of social interactions. \n3. CHARISMA CHECK \nWhen the adventurers get to the point o( their \nrequest, demand, or suggestion- or if you decide the \nconversation has run its course- call for a Charisma \ncheck. Any character who has actively participated in \nthe conversation can make the check. Depending on \nhow the adventurers handled the conversation, the \nPersuasion, Deception, or Intimidation skill might apply \nto the check. The creature's current attitude determines \nthe DC required to achieve a specific reaction, as shown \nin the Conversation Reaction table. \nCONVERSATION REACTION \nDC \nFriendly Creature's Reaction \n0 \nThe creature does as asked without taking risks or \nmaking sacrifices. \n10 \nThe creature accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do \nas asked. \n20 \nThe creature accepts a significant risk or sacrifice to \ndo as asked. \nDC \nIndifferent Creature's Reaction \n0 \nThe creature offers no help but does no harm . \n10 \nThe creature does as asked as long as no risks or \nsacrifices are involved. \n20 \nThe creature accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do \nas asked. \nDC \nHostile Creature's Reaction \n0 \nThe creature opposes the adventu rers' actions and \nmight take risks to do so. \n10 \n20 \nThe creature offers no help but does no harm. \nThe creature does as asked as long as no risks or \nsacrifices are involved. \nAiding the Check. Other characters who make \nsubstantial contributions to the conversation can help \nthe character making the check. If a helping character \nsays or does something that would influence the \ninteraction in a positive way, the character making \nthe Charisma check can do so with advantage. If \nthe other character inadvertently says something \ncounterproductive or offensive, the character making \nthe Charisma check has disadvantage on that check. \nMultiple Checks. Certain situations might call for \nmore than one check, particularly if the adventurers \ncome into the interaction with multiple goals. \n4. REPEAT? \nOnce a Charisma check has been made, further \nattempts to influence the target of the interaction might \nbe fruitless or run the risk of upsetting or angering the \nsubject creature, potentially shifting its attitude toward \nhostility. Use your best judgment. For example, if the \nparty's rogue says something that pushes a noble's \nattitude toward the party from indifferent to hostile, \nanother character might be able to diffuse the noble's \nhostility with clever roleplaying and a successful \nCharisma (Persuasion) check. \nRoLEPLAYING \nFor some DMs, roleplaying comes naturally. If it doesn't \ncome naturally for you, don't worry. The main thing is \nfor you to have fun portraying your NPCs and monsters \nand to amuse your players in the process. You don't \nneed to be a practiced thespian or comedian to create \ndrama or humor. The key is to pay attention to the story \nelements and characterizations that make your players \nlaugh or feel emotionally engaged and to incorporate \nthose things into your roleplaying. \nBEING THE NPC \nImagine how a character or monster you bring to life \nwould react to the adventurers. Consider what it cares \nabout. Does it have any ideals, flaws, or bonds? By \nworking such things into your portrayal, you not only \nmake the character or monster more believable, but you \nalso enhance the sense that the adventurers are in a \nliving world. \nStrive for responses and actions that introduce twists \ninto the game. For example, an old woman whose family \nwas killed at the hands of an evil wizard might regard \nthe party's wizard with grave suspicion. \nHowever you roleplay a character or monster, the \nclassic advice for writers holds true: show, don't tell. For \nexample, rather than describe an NPC as shallow and \nself-centered, have the individual act the way you would \nexpect a shallow, self-centered person to behave. The \nNPC might have off-the-cuff answers for everything, \nan over-willingness to share personal anecdotes, and a \ndesperate need to make himself or herself the subject of \nevery conversation. \nUSING YOUR VOICE \nMost of what you say during a session will be at a \nconsistent level. For dramatic effect, be ready to shout \nout a battle cry or speak in a conspiratorial whisper. \nCHAPTER 8 / RUNNING THE GAME \n245 \n"},

  'text': 'Also, characters and monsters with distinctive voices \nare memorable. If you\'re not a natural mimic or actor, \nborrowing distinctive speech patterns from real life, the \nmovies, or television is a good place to start. Practice \ndifferent voices and impersonations of famous people, \nthen use those voices to bring your NPCs to life. \nExperiment with different speech patterns. For \ninstance, a barmaid and a city magistrate probably use \ntheir words differently. Similarly, peasants could speak \nin earthy dialects, while rich folk talk in haughty drawls. \nLet a pirate NPC say, "Arrrr, maties!" in your best Long \nJohn Silver voice. Let intelligent monsters unfamiliar \nwith Common stumble along with awkward grammar. \nLet drunkards and monsters mutter with slurred \nspeech, while lizardfolk hiss their threats. \nIn any interaction with multiple NPCs, make sure \nthe adventurers remain the focus. Have the NPCs talk \nto them, not so much to each other. If possible, let one \nNPC do most of the talking, but if multiple NPCs need \nto talk, give them distinct voices so the players know \nwho\'s who. \nUsiNG YouR FAcE AND ARMS \nUse your facial expressions to help show a character\'s \nemotions. Scowl, smile, grin, snarl, pout, cross your \neyes-do whatever it takes to make the character or \nmonster memorable to the players. When you combine \nfacial expressions with an unusual voice, a character \ntruly comes to life. \nThough you don\'t need to stand up out of your chair, \nyou can use your arms to bring even more life to an \nNPC. A noble could chop the air with one hand while \nspeaking in a deadpan monotone, while an archmage \nmight express her displeasure by silently rolling her \neyes and massaging her temples with her fingers. \nENGAGING THE PLAYERS \nSome players enjoy roleplaying and interaction more \nthan others. Whatever your players\' tastes, your \nlively portrayal of NPCs and monsters can inspire \nplayers to make just as much investment in portraying \ntheir characters. This makes social interactions an \nopportunity for everyone to become more immersed \nin the game, creating a story whose protagonists \nhave depth. \nTo make sure everyone has something to do during a \nroleplaying-heavy game session, consider one or more of \nthe following approaches. \nAppeal to Player Preferences. There are in-game \nactivities that players enjoy more than others, as \ndiscussed in this book\'s introduction. Players who like \nacting thrive in interaction situations, and it\'s fine to ·let \nthose players take the spotlight. They often inspire other \nplayers by their example, but make sure those other \nplayers have an opportunity to join in the fun. \nPlayers who like exploring and storytelling are \nusually amenable to roleplaying, as long as it moves the \ncampaign forward and reveals more about the world. \nPlayers who like problem-solving often enjoy figuring \nout the right thing to say to shift an NPC\'s attitude. \nPlayers who are instigators like provoking reactions \nfrom NPCs, so they\'re often easily engaged-though not \nalways productively. \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME \nPlayers who like to optimize their characters and \nslay monsters also like to argue, and having conflict \nwithin an interaction can help those players embrace \nroleplaying. Still, creating combat connections to an \nextended interaction (such as a corrupt vizier sending \nassassins to kill the adventurers) is often the best way r \nkeep action-focused players engaged. \nTarget Specific Characters. Create situations where \ncharacters who might not otherwise be engaged with a \nsocial interaction have to do at least some of the talk in \nPerhaps the NPC in question is a family member or \na contact of a particular adventurer and talks only to \nthat character. An NPC of a certain race or class mighr \nlisten only to characters he or she feels a kinship with. \nCreating a sense of importance can be a great way to ge-\nspecific players engaged, but don\'t shut out players who \nare already roleplaying. \nIf a couple of players are dominating the conversation \ntake a moment now and then to involve the others. You \ncan do this in character if you like: "And what about you;-\nhulking friend? Speak, barbarian! What will you pledge \nin exchange for my favor?" Or just ask the player what \nhis or her character is doing while the conversation is \ngoing on. The first approach is better for players who are \nalready comfortable speaking in their characters\' voices \nThe second approach works better for players who neeri \nencouragement to engage in a roleplaying scenario. \nOBJECTS \nWhen characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a \nwindow, or smash a vampire\'s coffin, the only hard and \nfast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, \ncharacters can destroy any destructible object. Use \ncommon sense when determining a character\'s succe \nat damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a \nsection of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is \nlikely to break before the wall does. \nFor the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete. \ninanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, \ntable, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is \ncomposed of many other objects. \nSTATISTICS FOR OBJECTS \nWhen time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class \nand hit points to a destructible object. You can also give \nit immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific \ntypes of damage. \nArmor Class. An object\'s Armor Class is a measure \nof how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when \nstriking it (because the object has no chance of dodging \nout of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides \nsuggested AC values for various substances. \nOBJECT ARMOR CLASS \nSubstance \nAC \nSubstance \nAC \nCloth, paper, rope \n11 \nI ron, steel \n19 \nCrystal, glass, ice \n13 \nMithral \n21 \nWood, bone \n15 \nAdamantine \n23 \nStone \n17 \n'},

  'text': 'Hit Points. An object\'s hir points measure how much \ndamage it can take before lo ina i \nsrrucrural integrity. \nResilient objects have more hir pain than fragile ones. \nLarge objects also tend to ha\\·e more hir points than \nsmall ones, unless breaking a small part of rhe object is \njust as effective as breaking the whole rhing. The Object \nHit Points table provides suggested hir points for fragile \nand resilient objects that are Large or smaller. \nOBJECT HIT POINTS \nSize \nTiny (bottle, lock) \nSmall (chest, lute) \nMedium (barrel, chandelier) \nLarge (cart, 10-ft.·by-10-ft. window) \nFragile \n2 (1d4) \n3 (1d6) \n4 (1d8) \n5 (1d10) \nResilient \n5 (2d4) \n10 (3d6) \n18 (4d8) \n27 (5d10) \nHuge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are \nof little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, \nsuch as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or \nmassive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge \ntapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus \nto rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object\'s \nhit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long \nthe object can withstand whatever weapon or force is \nacting against it. If you track hit points for the object, \ndivide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each \nsection\'s hit points separately. Destroying one of those \nsections could ruin the entire object. For example, a \nGargantuan statue of a human might topple over when \none of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points. \nObjects and Damage Types. Objects are immune \nto poison and psychic damage. You might decide \nthat some damage types are more effective against a \nparticular object or substance than others. For example, \nbludgeoning damage works well for smashing things \nbut not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or \ncloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning \ndamage. A pick can chip away stone but can\'t effectively \ncut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment. \nDamage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls \noften have extra resilience represented by a damage \nthreshold. An object with a damage threshold has \nimmunity to all damage unless it takes an amount \nof damage from a single attack or effect equal to or \ngreater than its damage threshold, in which case it \ntakes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet \nor exceed the object\'s damage threshold is considered \nsuperficial and doesn\'t reduce the object\'s hit points. \nCOMBAT \nThis section builds on the combat rules in the Player\'s \nHandbook and offers tips for keeping the game running \nsmoothly when a fight breaks out. \nTRACKING INITIATIVE \nYou can use several different methods for keeping track \nof who goes when in combat. \nHIDDEN LIST \nMany DMs keep track of initiative on a list the players \ncan\'t see: usually a piece of paper behind a DM screen \nor a spreadsheet on a tablet computer. This method \nallows you to keep track of combatants who haven\'t been \nrevealed yet, and you can use the initiative list as a place \nto record the current hit points of monsters, as well as \nother useful notes. \nA downside of this approach is that you have to remind \nthe players round after round when their turns come up. \nVISIBLE LIST \nYou can use a whiteboard to track initiative. As the \nplayers tell you their initiative numbers, write them on \nthe whiteboard in order from highest to lowest, leaving \nspace between each name. Either write the monsters\' \ninitiatives on the list at the same time or add them to the \nlist on each monster\'s first turn. \nAs a further improvement, use magnets that you can \nattach to a metal-based whiteboard with characters\' and \nmonsters\' names written on them, or write those names \non cards held in place by magnets. \nA visible list lets everyone see the order of play. \nPlayers know when their turns are coming up, and they \ncan start planning their actions in advance. A visible list \nalso removes any uncertainty about when the monsters \nwill act in the fight. \nA variation on the visible list is to give one player \nresponsibility for keeping track of initiative, either on \na white board or on a piece of paper the other players \ncan see. This method reduces the number of things you \nneed to keep track of yourself. \nINDEX CARDS \nIn this approach, each character gets an index card, as \ndoes each group of identical monsters. When the players \ntell you their initiative numbers, write the numbers on \ntheir characters\' index cards. Do the same when you roll \nthe monsters\' initiative. Then arrange the cards in order \nfrom highest to lowest. Starting at the top, you move \ndown through the stack. When you call out the name of \nthe character whose turn it is, also mention who\'s next, \nprompting that player to start thinking ahead. After \neach character or group of monsters acts, the top card is \nmoved to the bottom of the stack. \nAt first, players don\'t know the order of play when \nyou use combat cards, and they don\'t know where the \nmonsters fall into the order until the monsters act. \nTRACKING MONSTER HIT POINTS \nDuring a combat encounter, you need to track how much \ndamage each monster takes. Most DMs track damage \nin secret so that their players don\'t know how many hit \npoints a monster has remaining. Whether you choose to \nbe secretive or not is up to you. What\'s important is that \nevery monster\'s hit points be tracked individually. \nTracking damage for one or two monsters isn\'t \nonerous, but it helps to have a system for larger \ngroups of monsters. If you aren\'t using miniatures \nor other visual aids, the easiest way to keep track \nof your monsters is to assign them unique features. \nDescriptions such as "the ogre with the nasty scar" \nand "the ogre with the horned helm" help you and your \nplayers track which monster is which. For example, \nimagine that you\'re running an encounter with three \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME \n247 \n'},

If you use identical miniatures to \nrepresent multiple monsters, you can tag the miniatures \nwith small stickers of different colors or stickers with \ndifferent letters or numbers on them. \nFor example, in a combat encounter with three ogres, \nyou could use three identical ogre miniatures tagged \nwith stickers marked A, B, and C, respectively. To track \nthe ogres' hit points, you can sort them by letter, then \nsubtract damage from their hit points as they take it. \nYour records might look something like this after a few \nrounds of combat: \nOgre A: 59~ 45 ~ \nt4 9 dead \nOgre B: 59 5t 30 \nOgre C: 59 \nPlayers often ask how hurt a monster looks. Don't ever \nfeel as though you need to reveal exact hit points, but if \na monster is below half its hit point maximum, it's fair to \nsay that it has visible wounds and appears beaten down. \nYou can describe a monster taken to half its hit points as \nbloodied, giving the players a sense of progress in a fight \nagainst a tough opponent, and helping them judge when \nto use their most powerful spells and abilities. \nTtNY \nSMALL \nUSING AND TRACKING CONDITIONS \nVarious rules and features in the game are clear abour \nwhen they apply a condition to a creature. You can also \napply conditions on the fly. They're meant to be intuitiYe \nfor you to do so. For example, if a character is in a state \nsuch as sleep, that lacks consciousness, you can say \nthe character is unconscious. Or did a character just \nstumble onto the ground? He or she is now prone. \nKeeping track of conditions can become tricky. \nFor monsters, it's often easiest to track conditions on \ncombat cards or wherever you track initiative. Players \nshould remember any conditions affecting their \ncharacters. Because players have incentive to forget or \noverlook hampering conditions, character conditions \ncan also be marked on combat cards or a whiteboard. \nYou might also try keeping a supply of index cards on \nhand, marked with conditions and their effects. Then \nhand the cards to players as the conditions come up. \nHaving a bright pink index card on top of a character \nsheet can help even the most absentminded player \nremember the effects of being charmed or frightened. \nMONSTERS AND CRITICAL HITS \nA monster follows the same rule for critical hits as \na player, character. That said, if you use a monster's \naverage damage, rather than rolling, you might wonder \nhow to handle a critical hit. When the monster scores \na critical hit, roll all the damage dice associated with \nthe hit and add them to the average damage. For \nexample, if a goblin normally deals 5 (ld6 + 2) slashing \ndamage on a hit and scores a critical hit, it deals 5 + l d6 \nslashing damage. \nGARGANTUAN \niiUGE \n"},

If you prefer more tactical nuance, consider \nusing miniatures. \nHANDLING MOBS \nKeeping combat moving along at a brisk pace can be \ndifficult when there are dozens of monsters involved \nin a battle. When handling a crowded battlefield, you \ncan speed up play by forgoing attack rolls in favor of \napproximating the average number of hits a large group \nof monsters can inflict on a target. \nInstead of rolling an attack roll, determine the \nminimum d20 roll a creature needs in order to hit a \ntarget by subtracting its attack bonus from the target's \nAC. You'll need to refer to the result throughout the \nbattle, so it's best to write it down. \nLook up the minimum d20 roll needed on the Mob \nAttacks table. The table shows you how many creatures \nthat need that die roll or higher must attack a target \nin order for one of them to hit. If that many creatures \nattack the target, their combined efforts result in one of \nthem hitting the target. \nFor example, eight orcs surround a fighter. The orcs' \nattack bonus is +5, and the fighter's AC is 19. The orcs \nneed a 14 or higher to hit the fighter. According to the \ntable, for every three orcs that attack the fighter, one \nof them hits. There are enough orcs for two groups of \nthree. The remaining two orcs fail to hit the fighter. \nIf the attacking creatures deal different amounts \nof damage, assume that the creature that deals the \nmost damage is the one that hits. If the creature that \nhits has multiple attacks with the same attack bonus, \nassume that it hits once with each of those attacks. If a \ncreature's attacks have different attack bonuses, resolve \neach attack separately. \nThis attack resolution system ignores critical hits in \nfavor of reducing the number of die rolls. As the number \nof combatants dwindles, switch back to using individual \ndie rolls to avoid situations where one side can't possibly \nhit the other. \nMOB ATTACKS \nd20 Roll \nAttackers Needed \nNeeded \nfor One to Hit \n1-5 \n6-12 \n2 \n13-14 \n3 \n15-16 \n4 \n17-18 \n5 \n19 \n10 \n20 \n20 \nUSING MINIATURES \nIn combat, players can often rely on your description \nto visualize where their characters are in relation to \ntheir surroundings and their enemies. Some complex \nbattles, however, are easier to run with visual aids, the \nmost common of which are miniatures and a grid. If y \nlike to construct model terrain, build three-dimension \ndungeons, or draw maps on large vinyl mats, you sho -\nalso consider using miniatures. \nThe Player's Handbook offers simple rules for \ndepicting combat using miniature figures on a grid. T'- -\nsection expands on that material. \nTACTICAL MAPS \nYou can draw tactical maps with colored markers on a \nwet-erase vinyl mat with l-inch squares, on a large sh -\nof paper, or on a similar flat surface. Preprinted poster-\nsized maps, maps assembled from cardboard tiles, anc. \nterrain made of sculpted plaster or resin are also fun. \nThe most common unit for tactical maps is the 5-foo:: \nsquare, and maps with grids are readily available and \neasy to create. However, you don't have to use a grid a \nall. You can track distances with a tape measure, string \ncraft sticks, or pipe cleaners cut to specific lengths. \nAnother option is a play surface covered by l-inch \nhexagons (often called hexes), which combines the eas_ \ncounting of a grid with the more flexible movement of \nusing no grid. Dungeon corridors with straight walls \nand right angles don't map easily onto hexes, though. \nfLANK!

  'text': "CREATURE SIZE ON SQUARES A \nD HEXES \nA creature's size determines how much space it \noccupies on squares or hexes, as shown in the Creature \nSize and Space table. If the miniature you use for a \nmonster takes up an amount of space different from \nwhat's on the table, that's fine, but treat the monster \nas its official size for all other rules. For example, \nyou might use a miniature that has a Large base to \nrepresent a Huge giant. That giant takes up less space \non the battlefield than its size suggests, but it is still \nHuge for the purposes of rules like grappling. \nCREATURE SIZE AND SPACE \nSize \nSpace: Squares \nSpace: Hexes \nTiny \n4 per square \n4 per hex \nSmall \n1 square \n1 hex \nMedium \n1 square \n1 hex \nLarge \n4 squares (2 by 2) \n3 hexes \nHuge \n9 squares (3 by 3) \n7 hexes \nGargantuan \n16 squares (4 by 4) or more \n12 hexes or more \nA REAS OF EFFECT \nThe area of effect of a spell, monster ability, or other \nfeature must be translated onto squares or hexes to \ndetermine which potential targets are in the area and \nwhich aren't. \nChoose an intersection of squares or hexes as the \npoint of origin of an area of effect, then follow its rules \nas normal. If an area of effect is circular and covers at \nleast half a square, it affects that square. \nL INE OF SIGHT \nTo precisely determine whether there is line of sight \nbetween two spaces, pick a corner of one space and \nrrace an imaginary line from that corner to any part \nof another space. If at least one such line doesn't pass \nthrough or touch an object or effect that blocks vision-\nsuch as a stone wall, a thick curtain, or a dense cloud of \nfog-then there is line of sight. \nC OVER \nTo determine whether a target has cover against an \nattack or other effect on a grid, choose a corner of the \nanacker's space or the point of origin of an area of effect. \nThen trace imaginary lines from that corner to every \ncorner of any one square the target occupies. If one or \ntwo of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including \nanother creature), the target has half cover. If three or \nfour of those lines are blocked but the attack can still \nreach the target (such as when the target is behind an \narrow slit), the target has three-quarters cover. \nOn hexes, use the same procedure as a grid, drawing \nlines between the corners of the hexagons. The target \nhas half cover if up to three lines are blocked by an \nobstacle, and three-quarters cover if four or more lines \nare blocked but the attack can still reach the target. \nOPTIONAL RULE : FLANKING \nIf you regularly use miniatures, flanking gives \ncombatants a simple way to gain advantage on attack \nrolls against a common enemy. \nA creature can't flank an enemy that it can't see. A \ncreature also can't flank while it is incapacitated. A \nLarge or larger creature is flanking as long as at least \none square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking. \nFlanking on Squares. When a creature and at \nleast one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on \nopposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they \nflank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on \nmelee attack rolls against that enemy. \nWhen in doubt about whether two creatures flank \nan enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between \nthe centers of the creatures' spaces. If the line passes \nthrough opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, \nthe enemy is flanked. \nFlanking on Hexes. When a creature and at least one \nof its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite \nsides of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy, and \neach of them has advantage on attack rolls against \nthat enemy. On hexes, count around the enemy from \none creature to its ally. Against a Medium or smaller \ncreature, the allies flank if there are 2 hexes between \nthem. Against a Large creature, the allies flank if there \nare 4 hexes between them. Against a Huge creature, \nthey must have 5 hexes between them. Against a \nGargantuan creature, they must have at least 6 hexes \nbetween them. \nFLANKING (f-lEXES) \n11ALF CovER ( 11EXES) \nTHREE · QUARTERS Co v ER (11EXES) \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNlNG THE GAME \n"},

  'text': "OPTIONAL RULE: DIAGONALS \nThe Player's Handbook presents a simple method for \ncounting movement and measuring range on a grid: \ncount every square as 5 feet, even if you're moving \ndiagonally. Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws \nof geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This \noptional rule provides more realism, but it requires \nmore effort during combat. \nWhen measuring range or moving diagonally on a \ngrid, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the \nsecond diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern \nof 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you're \ncounting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or \nvertically between different bits of diagonal movement. \nFor example, a character might move one square \ndiagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight (15 feet), \nand then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total \nmovement of 30 feet. \nOPTIONAL RuLE : FACING \nIf you want the precision of knowing which way a \ncreature is facing, consider using this optional rule. \nWhenever a creature ends its move, it can change its \nfacing. Each creature has a front arc (the direction it \nfaces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature \ncan also change its facing as a reaction when any other \ncreature moves. \nA creature can normally target only creatures in its \nfront or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This \nmeans an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes \nattack rolls against it with advantage. \nShields apply their bonus to AC only against attacks \nfrom the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For \nexample, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it \nonly against attacks from the front and left arcs. \nFeel free to determine that not all creatures have \nevery type of arc. For example, an amorphous ochre \njelly could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a \nhydra might have three front arcs and one rear one. \nOn squares, you pick one side of a creature's space \nas the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line \noutward from each corner of this side to determine the \nsquares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space \ndetermines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining \nspaces to either side of the creature form its side arcs. \nOn hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs \nrequires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's \nspace and create a wedge shape expanding out from \nthere for the front arc, and another on the opposite side \nof the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to \neither side of the creature are its side arcs. \nA square or hex might be in more than one arc, \ndepending on how you draw the lines from a creature's \nspace. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one \narc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle, \nuse this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it's in that \narc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in \nthe side arc. \nCHAPTER 8 \\ RUNNING THE GAME \nADJUDICATING REACTION TIMING \nTypical combatants rely on the opportunity attack \nand the Ready action for most of their reactions in a \nfight. Various spells and features give a creature more \nreaction options, and sometimes the timing of a reacti -\ncan be difficult to adjudicate. Use this rule of thumb: \nfollow whatever timing is specified in the reaction's \ndescription. For example, the opportunity attack and \nthe shield spell are clear about the fact that they can \ninterrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing \nspecified, or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs \nafter its trigger finishes, as in the Ready action. \nCHASES \nStrict application of the movement rules can turn a \npotentially exciting chase into a dull, predictable affair. \nFaster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while \ncreatures with the same speed never close the distance \nbetween each other. This set of rules can make chase \nmore exciting by introducing random elements. \nBEGINNING A CHASE \nA chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any \nparticipants not already in initiative order must roll \ninitiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase \ncan take one action and move on its turn. The chase \nends when one side drops out or the quarry escapes. \nWhen a chase begins, determine the starting \ndistance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track \nthe distance between them, and designate the pursuer \nclosest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer migh· \nchange from round to round. \nRUNNING THE CHASE \nParticipants in the chase are strongly motivated to use \nthe Dash action every round. Pursuers who stop to casr \nspells and make attacks run the risk of losing their \nquarry, and a quarry that does so is likely to be caught. \nDASHING \nDuring the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash \naction a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution \nmodifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during \nthe chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 \nConstitution check at the end of its turn or gain one !eve. \nof exhaustion. \nA participant drops out of the chase if its exhaustion \nreaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature \ncan remove the levels of exhaustion it gained during the \nchase by finishing a short or long rest. \nSPELLS AND ATTACKS \nA chase participant can make attacks and cast spells \nagainst other creatures within range. Apply the \nnormal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks \nand spells. \nChase participants can't normally make opportunity \nattacks against each other, since they are all assumed \nto be moving in the same direction at the same time. \n"},

The \nresult is compared to the passive\\ isdom (Perception) \nscores of the pursuers.

Otherwise, if the result of \nthe quarry's check is greater than the highest passive \nscore, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues \nfor another round. \nThe quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its \ncheck based on prevailing circumstances, as shown in \nthe Escape Factors table.

For example, in an urban \nsetting, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a \ncrowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to \nwhere it went. \nCHASE COMPLICATIONS \nAs with any good chase scene, complications can arise \nto make a chase more pulse-pounding. The Urban \nChase Complications table and the Wilderness Chase \nComplications table provide several examples. \nComplications occur randomly. Each participant in \nthe chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the \nappropriate table to determine whether a complication \noccurs.

Run a round of one chase, then a round of \nthe next, and so on, tracking the distances for each \nseparate group. \nMAPPING THE CHASE \nIf you have the opportunity to plan out a chase, take \nthe time to draw a rough map that shows the route. \nInsert obstacles at specific points, especially ones that \nrequire the characters to make ability checks or saving \nthrows to avoid slowing or stopping, or use a random \ntable of complications similar to the ones in this section. \nOtherwise, improvise as you play. \nComplications can be barriers to progress or \nopportunities for mayhem. Characters being chased \nthrough a forest by bugbears might spot a wasp nest \nand slow down long enough to attack the nest or throw \nrocks at it, thus creating an obstacle for their pursuers. \nA map of a chase can be linear or have many \nbranches, depending on the nature of the chase. For \nexample, a mine cart chase might have few (if any) \nbranches, while a sewer chase might have several. \nROLE REVERSAL \nDuring a chase, it's possible for the pursuers to become \nthe quarry. For example, characters chasing a thief \nthrough a marketplace might draw unwanted attention \nfrom other members of the thieves' guild. As they \npursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves \npursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and \nrun both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, \nthe fleeing thief might run into the waiting arms of his \naccomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide \nto flee with the thieves in pursuit. \nSIEGE EQUIPMENT \nSiege weapons are designed to assail castles and other \nwalled fortifications. They see much use in campaigns \nthat feature war. Most siege weapons don't move around \na battlefield on their own; they require creatures to move \nthem, as well as to load, aim, and fire them. \nBALLISTA \nLarge object \nArmor Class: 15 \nHit Points: 50 \nDamage Immunities: poison, psychic \nA ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts. \nBefore it can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed.

Once emptied, a \ncauldron must be refilled-and its contents must usually \nbe reheated- before it can be used again. It takes three \nactions to fill a cauldron and one action to tip it. \nCauldrons can be filled with other liquids, such as \nacid or green slime, with different effects. \nBoiling Oil. The cauldron pours boiling oil onto a \n10-foot-square area directly below it. Any creature in the \narea must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking \n10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much \ndamage on a successful one. \nMANGONEL \nLarge object \nArmor Class: 15 \nHit Points: 100 \nDamage Immunities: poison, psychic \nA mangonel is a type of catapult that hurls heavy \nprojectiles in a high arc. This payload can hit targets \nbehind cover. Before the mangonel can be fired, it must \nbe loaded and aimed. It takes two actions to load the \nweapon, two actions to aim it, and one action to fire it. \nA mangonel typically hurls a heavy stone, although it \ncan hurl other kinds of projectiles, with different effects. \nMangone} Stone.

An adventurer emerges from \nan ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon \nfinds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock \noffends some dark power and contracts a strange \naffliction that spreads whenever he casts spells. \nA simple outbreak might amount to little more than \na small drain on party resources, curable by a casting \nof lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can \nform the basis of one or more adventures as characters \nsearch for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and \ndeal with the consequences. \nA disease that does more than infect a few party \nmembers is primarily a plot device. The rules help \ndescribe the effects of the disease and how it can be \ncured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren\'t \nbound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect \nany creature, and a given illness might or might not \npass from one race or kind of creature to another. A \nplague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep \nthrough a halfling neighborhood but leave other races \nuntouched. What matters is the story you want to tell. \nSAMPLE DISEASES \nThe diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease \ncan work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving \nthrow DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other \ncharacteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign. \n'},

  'text': '~ACKLE FEVER \n-:-his disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are \n:;rrangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, \n·ctims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, \ngiving the disease its common name and its morbid \n::Uckname: "the shrieks." \nSymptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and \nmclude fever and disorientation. The infected creature \ngains one level of exhaustion that can\'t be removed until \nLhe disease is cured. \nAny event that causes the infected creature great \n-rress- including entering combat, taking damage, \nexperiencing fear, or having a nightmare- forces the \ncreature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. \nDn a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic \ndamage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter \nor 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw \nar the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter \nand the incapacitated condition on a success. \nAny humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 \nieet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter \nmust succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or \nalso become infected with the disease. Once a creature \nucceeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter \nof that particular infected creature for 24 hours. \nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature \ncan make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a \nuccessful save, the DC for this save and for the save to \navoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the \naving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from \nrhe disease. A creature that fails three of these saving \nrhrows gains a randomly determined form of indefinite \nmadness, as described later in this chapter. \nS EWER PLAGUE \nSewer plague is a generic term for a broad category \nof illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, \nand stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes \ntransmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such \nas rats and otyughs. \nWhen a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that \ncarries the disease, or when it comes into contact with \nfi lth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature \nmust succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or \nbecome infected. \nIt takes 1d4 days for sewer plague\'s symptoms to \nmanifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include \nfatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one \nlevel of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal \nnumber of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit \npoints from finishing a long rest. \nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature \nmust make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a \nfailed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. \nOn a successful save, the character\'s exhaustion level \ndecreases by one level. If a successful saving throw \nreduces the infected creature\'s level of exhaustion below \n1, the creature recovers from the disease. \nSIGHT RoT \nThis painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and \neventually blinds the victim. \nA beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by \nsight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving \nthrow or become infected. One day after infection, the \ncreature\'s vision starts to become blurry. The creature \ntakes a - 1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks \nthat rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the \nsymptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When \nit reaches - 5, the victim is blinded until its sight is \nrestored by magic such as Jesser restoration or heal. \nSight rot can be cured using a rare flower called \nEyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, \na character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit \ncan turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied \nto the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents \nthe disease from worsening after that rest. After three \ndoses, the ointment cures the disease entirely. \nPorsoNs \nGiven their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are \nillegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among \nassassins, draw, and other evil creatures. \nPoisons come in the following four types. \nContact. A creature that touches contact poison with \nexposed skin suffers its effects. \nIngested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of \ningested poison to suffer its effects. You might decide \nthat a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing \nadvantage on the saving throw or dealing only half \ndamage on a failed save. \nInhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that \ntake effect when they are inhaled. A single dose fills a \n5-foot cube. \nInjury. A creature that takes slashing or piercing \ndamage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated \nwith injury poison is exposed to its effects. \nPOISONS \nItem \nType \nPrice per Dose \nAssassin\'s blood \nIngested \n150 gp \nBurnt othur fumes \nInhaled \n500 gp \nCarrion crawler mucus \nContact \n200 gp \nDraw poison \nInjury \n200 gp \nEssence of ether \nInhaled \n300 gp \nMalice \nInhaled \n250 gp \nMidnight tears \nIngested \n1,500 gp \nOil of taggit \nContact \n400 gp \nPale tincture \nIngested \n250 gp \nPurple worm poison \nInjury \n2,000 gp \nSerpent venom \nInjury \n200 gp \nTorpor \nIngested \n600 gp \nTruth serum \nIngested \n150 gp \nWyvern poison \nInjury \n1,200 gp \nSAMPLE POISONS \n-------\nEach type of poison has its own debilitating effects. \nAssassin\'s Blood (Ingested).

Other characters might \nhave to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before \nthey track down the poison they seek. \nThe Poisons table gives suggested prices for single \ndoses of various poisons. \nCRAFTING AND HARVESTING POISO -\nDuring downtime between adventures, a character \ncan use the crafting rules in the Player's Handbook to \ncreate basic poison if the character has proficiency with \na poisoner's kit At your discretion, the character can \ncraft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients \nare available for purchase, and tracking down certain \ningredients might form the basis of an entire adventure. \nA character can instead attempt to harvest poison \nfrom a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or \ncarrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or \ndead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed \nby a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency \nwith the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the \ncharacter doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a \nsuccessful check, the character harvests enough poison \nfor a single dose. On a failed check, the character is \nunable to extract any poison. If the character fails the \ncheck by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the \ncreature's poison. \nMADNESS \nIn a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad \nby the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict \nday after day, but sometimes the stress of being an \nadventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign \nhas a strong horror theme, you might want to use \nmadness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing \n"},

Certain spells, such as contact \nother plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can \nuse the madness rules here instead of the spell effects \nin the Player\'s Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar \neffects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of \nPandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts \ncan also break the psyche of a character who uses or \nbecomes attuned to them. \nResisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires \na Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game \nincludes the Sanity score (see chapter 9, "Dungeon \nMaster\'s Workshop"), a creature makes a Sanity saving \nthrow instead. \nMADNESS EFFECTS \n-----\nMadness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. \nMost relatively mundane effects impose short-term \nmadness, which lasts for just a few minutes.

If a player is absent \nfor a session, the player\'s character misses out on the \nexperience points. \nOver time, you might end up with a level gap between \nthe characters of players who never miss a session and \ncharacters belonging to players who are more sporadic \nin their attendance. Nothing is wrong with that. A gap \nof two or three levels between different characters in \nthe same party isn\'t going to ruin the game for anyone. \nSome DMs treat XP as a reward for participating in \nthe game, and keeping up with the rest of the party is \ngood incentive for players to attend as many sessions \nas possible. \nAs an alternative, give absent characters the same \nXP that the other characters earned each session, \nkeeping the group at the same level.

  'text': "NONCOMBAT CHALLE .. GES ------:-\nYou decide whether to award experience to characters \nfor overcoming challenges out ide combat. If the \nadventurers complete a ten e negotiation with a baron, \nforge a trade agreement with a clan of surly dwarves, \nor successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom, you might \ndecide that they deserve an XP reward. \nAs a starting point, use the rules for building combat \nencounters in chapter 3 to gauge the difficulty of the \nchallenge. Then award the characters XP as if it had \nbeen a combat encounter of the same difficulty, but only \nif the encounter involved a meaningful risk of fa ilure. \nMILESTONES \nYou can also award XP when characters complete \nsignificant milestones. When preparing your adventure, \ndesignate certain events or challenges as milestones, as \nwith the following examples: \nAccomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to \ncomplete the adventure. \nDiscovering a hidden location or piece of information \nrelevant to the adventure. \nReaching an important destination. \nWhen awarding XP, treat a major milestone as a hard \nencounter and a minor milestone as an easy encounter. \nIf you want to reward your players for their progress \nthrough an adventure with something more than XP \nand treasure, give them additional small rewards at \nmilestone points. Here are some examples: \nThe adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest. \nCharacters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level \nspell slot. \nCharacters can regain the use of magic items that \nhave had their limited uses expended. \nLEVEL ADVANCEMENT WITHOUT XP \nYou can do away with experience points entirely and \ncontrol the rate of character advancement. Advance \ncharacters based on how many sessions they play, or \nwhen they accomplish significant story goals in the \ncampaign. In either case, you tell the players when their \ncharacters gain a level. \nThis method of level advancement can be particularly \nhelpful if your campaign doesn't include much \ncombat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP \nbecomes tiresome. \nSESSION-BASED ADVANCEMENT \nA good rate of session-based advancement is to have \ncharacters reach 2nd level after the first session of play, \n3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two \nmore sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for \neach subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard \nrate of advancement, assuming sessions are about four \nhours long. \nSTORY-BASED ADVANCEMENT \nWhen you let the story of the campaign drive \nadvancement, you award levels when adventurers \naccomplish significant goals in the campaign. \nCHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME \n26! \n"},

  'text': "CHAPTER 9: DuNGEON MASTER's WoRKSHOP \nS THE D UNGEON M ASTER, YOU AREN'T LIMITED \nby the rules in the Player's Handbook, the \nguidelines in this book, or the selection of \nmonsters in the Monster Manual. You can \nlet your imagination run wild. This chapter \ncontains optional rules that you can use to \ncustomize your campaign, as well as guidelines on \ncreating your own material, such as monsters and \nmagic items. \nThe options in this chapter relate to many different \nparts of the game. Some of them are variants of \nrules, and others are entirely new rules. Each option \nrepresents a different genre, style of play, or both. \nConsider trying no more than one or two of the options \nat a time so that you can clearly assess their effects on \nyour campaign before adding other options. \nBefore you add a new rule to your campaign, ask \nyourself two questions: \n• Will the rule improve the game? \n• Will my players like it? \nIf you're confident that the answer to both questions is \nyes, then you have nothing to lose by giving it a try. Urge \nyour players to provide feedback. If the rule or game \nelement isn't functioning as intended or isn't adding \nmuch to your game, you can refine it or ditch it. No \nmatter what a rule's source, a rule serves you, not the \nother way around. \nBeware of adding anything to your game that allows \na character to concentrate on more than one effect at \na time, use more than one reaction or bonus action \nper round, or attune to more than three magic items \nat a time. Rules and game elements that override the \nrules for concentration, reactions, bonus actions, and \nmagic item attunement can seriously unbalance or \novercomplicate your game. \nABILITY OPTIONS \nThe optional rules in this section pertain to using \nability scores. \nPROFICIENCY DICE \n------------------\nThis optional rule replaces a character's proficiency \nbonus with a proficiency die, adding more randomness \nto the game and making proficiency a less reliable \nindicator of mastery. Instead of adding a proficiency \nbonus to an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw, \nthe character's player rolls a die. The Proficiency Die \ntable shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by \nthe character's level. \nWhenever a feature, such as the rogue's Expertise, \nlets a character double his or her proficiency bonus, \nthe player rolls the character's proficiency die twice \ninstead of once. \nThis option is intended for player characters and \nnon player characters who have levels, as opposed to \nmonsters who don't. \nPROFICIENCY DIE \nLevel \nProficiency Bonus \nProficiency Die \n1st-4th \n+2 \n1d4 \n5th-8th \n+3 \n1d6 \n9th-12th \n+4 \n1d8 \n13th- 16th \n+5 \n1d10 \n17th-20th \n+6 \n1d12 \nSKILL VARIANTS \nA skill dictates the circumstances under which a \ncharacter can add his or her proficiency bonus to an \nability check. Skills define those circumstances by \nreferring to different aspects of the six ability scores. \nFor example, Acrobatics and Stealth are two different \naspects of Dexterity, and a character can specialize in \neither or both. \nYou can dispense with skills and use one of the \nfollowing variants. Choose whichever one best suits \nyour campaign. \nABILITY CHECK PROFICIENCY \nWith this variant rule, characters don't have skill \nproficiencies. Instead, each character has proficiency \nin two abilities: one tied to the character's class and \none tied to the character's background. The Ability \nProficiencies by Class table suggests a proficiency for \neach class, and you choose which ability is tied to a \ngiven background. Starting at 1st level, a character adds \nhis or her proficiency bonus to any ability check tied to \none or the other of these two abilities. \nABILITY CHECK PROFICIENCIES BY CLASS \nClass \nAbility Check \nBarbarian \nStrength, Dexterity, or Wisdom \nBard \nAny one \nCleric \nIntelligence, Wisdom , or Charisma \nDruid \nIntelligence or Wisdom \nFighter \nStrength, Dexterity, or Wisdom \nMonk \nStrength, Dexterity, or Intelligence \nPaladin \nStrength, Wisdom, or Charisma \nRanger \nRogue \nSorcerer \nWarlock \nWizard \nStrength, Dexterity, or Wisdom \nDexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma \nIntelligence or Charisma \nIntelligence or Charisma \nIntelligence or Wisdom \nThe Expertise feature works differently than normal \nunder this rule. At 1st level, instead of choosing two \nskill proficiencies, a character with the Expertise class \nfeature chooses one of the abilities in which he or she \nhas proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two \nof the character's Expertise choices. If the character \nwould gain an additional skill proficiency, that character \ninstead selects another ability check in which to gain \nproficiency. \nH \nPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \n"},

  'text': 'This option removes skills from the game and \ndoesn\'t allow for much distinction among characters. \nFor example, a character can\'t choose to emphasize \npersuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally \nadept at both. \nBACKGROUND PROFICIENCY \nWith this variant rule, characters don\'t have skill or tool \nproficiencies. Anything that would grant the character \na skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead, \na character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any \nability check to which the character\'s prior training and \nexperience (reflected in the character\'s background) \nreasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of \nwhether the character\'s background applies. \nFor example, the player of a character with the noble \nbackground could reasonably argue that the proficiency \nbonus should apply to a Charisma check the character \nmakes to secure an audience with the king. The player \nshould be encouraged to explain in specific terms how \nthe character\'s background applies. Not simply "I\'m \na noble," but "I spent three years before starting my \nadventuring career serving as my family\'s ambassador \nto the court, and this sort of thing is second nature \nto me now." \nThis simple system relies heavily on players \ndeveloping their characters\' histories. Don\'t let it \nresult in endless debates about whether a character\'s \nproficiency bonus applies in a given situation. Unless \na player\'s attempt to explain the relevance of the \ncharacter\'s background makes everyone else at the table \nroll their eyes at its absurdity, go ahead and reward the \nplayer for making the effort. \nIf a character has the Expertise feature, instead \nof choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of \nthat feature, the player defines aspects of his or her \nbackground to which the benefit applies. Continuing \nthe noble example, the player might decide to apply \nExpertise to "situations where courtly manners and \netiquette are paramount" and "figuring out the secret \nplots that court members hatch against one another." \nPERSONALITY TRAIT PROFICIENCY \nWith this variant rule, characters don\'t have skill \nproficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her \nproficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to \nthe character\'s positive personality traits. For example, \na character with a positive personality trait of "I never \nhave a plan, but I\'m great at making things up as I go \nalong" might apply the bonus when engaging in some \noff-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player \nshould come up with at least four positive personalit)l \ntraits when creating a character. \nWhen a character\'s negative personality trait directly \nimpacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage \non the check. For example, a hermit whose negative \ntrait is "I often get lost in my own thoughts and \ncontemplation, oblivious to my surroundings" might \nhave disadvantage on an ability check made to notice \ncreatures sneaking up. \nIf a character has the Expertise feature, the player can \napply its benefit to personality traits related to ability \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER\'S WORKSHOP \nchecks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would \ngain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead \ngains a new positive personality trait. \nThis system relies heavily on players developing \ntheir characters\' personalities. Make sure that different \ncharacters\' traits- positive and negative- come into play \nwith about the same frequency. Don\'t let a player get \naway with a positive trait that always seems to apply and \na negative trait that never does. \nAt your discretion, you can also tie a character\'s \nideals, bonds, and flaws to this system. \nHERO POINTS \nHero points work well in epic fantasy and mythic \ncampaigns in which the characters are meant to be \nmore like superheroes than the average adventurer is. \nWith this option, a character starts with 5 hero point \nat 1st level. Each time the character gains a level, he or \nshe loses any unspent hero points and gains a new total \nequal to 5 + half the character\'s level. \nA player can spend a hero point whenever he or she \nmakes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw \nThe player can spend the hero point after the roll is \nmade but before any of its results are applied. Spend in_ \nthe hero point allows the player to roll a d6 and add it \nto the d20, possibly turning a failure into a success. A \nplayer can spend only 1 hero point per roll. \nIn addition, whenever a character fails a death saving \nthrow, the player can spend one hero point to turn the \nfailure into a success. \nNEW ABILITY SCORES: \nHONOR AND SANITY \nIf you\'re running a campaign shaped by a strict code of \nhonor or the constant risk of insanity, consider adding \none or both these new ability scores: Honor and Sani _ \nThese abilities function like the standard six abilities. \nwith exceptions specified in each ability below. \nHere\'s how to incorporate these optional abilities at \ncharacter creation: \nIf your players use the standard array of ability \nscores, add one 11 to the array for each optional \nability you add. \nIf your players use the optional point-buy system, add \n3 points to the number of points for each optional \nability you add. \nIf your players roll their ability scores, have them roll \nfor the added ability scores. \nIf you ever need to make a check or saving throw for \nHonor or Sanity for a monster that lacks the score, you \ncan use Charisma for Honor and Wisdom for Sanity. \nHoNOR ScoRE \nIf your campaign involves cultures where a rigid code \nof honor is part of daily life, consider using the Honor \nscore as a means of measuring a character\'s devotion \nto that code. This ability fits well in a setting inspired \nby Asian cultures, such as Kara-Tur in the Forgotten \nRealms. The Honor ability is also useful in any \ncampaign that revolves around orders of knights. \n'},

  'text': "Honor measures not only a character's devotion to a \ncode but also the character's understanding of it. The \nHonor score can also reflect how others perceive a \ncharacter's honor. A character with a high Honor usually \nhas a reputation that others know about, especially \nthose who have high Honor scores themselves. \nUnlike other abilities, Honor can't be raised with \nnormal ability score increases. Instead, you can award \nincreases to Honor- or impose reductions- based on \na character's actions. At the end of an adventure, if you \nthink a character's actions in the adventure reflected \nwell or poorly on his or her understanding of the code, \nyou can increase or decrease the character's Honor by \n1. As with other ability scores, a character's Honor can't \nexceed 20 or fall below 1. \nHonor Checks. Honor checks can be used in social \nsituations, much as Charisma would, when a character's \nunderstanding of a code of conduct is the most defining \nfactor in the way a social interaction will play out. \nYou might also call for an Honor check when a \ncharacter is in one of the following situations: \nBeing unsure how to act with honor \n• Surrendering while trying to save face \nTrying to determine another character's Honor score \nTrying to use the proper etiquette in a delicate \nsocial situation \nUsing his or her honorable or dishonorable reputation \nto influence someone else \nHonor Saving Throws. An Honor saving throw \ncomes into play when you want to determine whether \na character might inadvertently do something \ndishonorable. You might call for an Honor saving throw \nin the following situations: \nAvoiding an accidental breach of honor or etiquette \nResisting the urge to respond to goading or insults \nfrom an enemy \nRecognizing when an enemy attempts to trick a \ncharacter into a breach of honor \nSANITY ScoRE \nConsider using the Sanity score if your campaign \nrevolves around entities of an utterly alien and \nunspeakable nature, such as Great Cthulhu, whose \npowers and minions can shatter a character's mind. \nA character with a high Sanity is level-headed even in \nthe face of insane circumstances, while a character with \nlow Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted \nby eldritch horrors that are beyond normal reason. \nSanity Checks. You might ask characters to make a \nSanity check in place of an Intelligence check to recall \nlore about the alien creatures of madness featured \nin your campaign, to decipher the writings of raving \nlunatics, or to learn spells from tomes of forbidden lore. \nYou might also call for a Sanity check when a character \ntries one of the following activities: \nDeciphering a piece of text written in a language so \nalien that it threatens to break a character's mind \nOvercoming the lingering effects of madness \n• Comprehending a piece of alien magic foreign to all \nnormal understanding of magic \nSanity Saving Throws. You might call for a Sanity \nsaving throw when a character runs the risk of \nsuccumbing to madness, such as in the following \nsituations: \nSeeing a creature from the Far Realm or other alien \nrealms for the first time \n• Making direct contact with the mind of an \nalien creature \nBeing subjected to spells that affect mental stability, \nsuch as the insanity option of the symbol spell \nPassing through a demiplane built on alien physics \nResisting an effect conferred by an attack or spell that \ndeals psychic damage \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \n"},

  'text': 'CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER\'S WORKSHOP \nA failed Sanity save might result in short-term, long-\nterm, or indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, \n"Running the Game." Any time a character suffers from \nlong-term or indefinite madness, the character\'s Sanity \nis reduced by 1. A greater restoration spell can restore \nSanity lost in this way, and a character can increase his \nor her Sanity through level advancement. \nADVENTURING OPTIONS \nThis section provides options for changing how rests \nwork, as well as for adding unusual things to your \ncampaign, such as modern weapons. \nFEAR AND HORROR \nThe rules for fear and horror can help you sustain an \natmosphere of dread in a dark fantasy campaign. \nFEAR \nWhen adventurers confront threats they have no \nhope of overcoming, you can call for them to make a \nWisdom saving throw. Set the DC according to the \ncircumstances. A character who fails the save becomes \nfrightened for 1 minute. The character can repeat the \nsaving throw at the end of each of his or her turns, \nending the effect on the character on a successful save. \nHORROR \nHorror involves more than simple fright. It entails \nrevulsion and anguish. Often it arises when adventurer \nsee something completely contrary to the common \nunderstanding of what can and should occur in the \nworld, or upon the realization of a dreadful truth. \nIn such a situation, you can call on characters to make \na Charisma saving throw to resist the horror. Set the DC \nbased on the magnitude of the horrific circumstances. \nOn a failed save, a character gains a short-term or long-\nterm form of madness that you choose or determine \nrandomly, as detailed in chapter 8, "Running the Game.-\nHEALING \nThese optional rules make it easier or harder for \nadventurers to recover from injury, either increasing \nor reducing the amount of time your players can spend \nadventuring before rest is required. \nHEALER\'S KIT DEPENDENCY \nA character can\'t spend any Hit Dice after finishing a \nshort rest until someone expends one use of a healer\'s \nkit to bandage and treat the character\'s wounds. \nHEALING SuRGES \nThis optional rule allows characters to heal up in \nthe thick of combat and works well for parties that \nfeature few or no characters with healing magic, or for \ncampaigns in which magical healing is rare. \nAs an action, a character can use a healing surge and \nspend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die \nspent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the \ncharacter\'s Constitution modifier. The character regains \nhit points equal to the total. The player can decide to \nspend an additional Hit Die after each roll. \n'},

  'text': 'A character who uses a healing surge can\'t do so \nagain until he or she finishes a short or long rest. \nUnder this optional rule, a character regains all spent \nHit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, \na character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level \ndivided by four (minimum of one die). \nFor a more superheroic feel, you can let a character \nuse a healing surge as a bonus action, rather than as \nan action. \nSLOW NATURAL HEALING \nCharacters don\'t regain hit points at the end of a long \nrest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at \nthe end of a long rest, just as with a short rest. \nThis optional rule prolongs the amount of time that \ncharacters need to recover from their wounds without \nthe benefits of magical healing and works well for \ngrittier, more realistic campaigns. \nREST VARIANTS \nThe rules for short and long rests presented in chapter \n8 of the Player\'s Handbook work well for a heroic-style \ncampaign. Characters can go toe-to-toe with deadly foes, \ntake damage to within an inch of their lives, yet still be \nready to fight again the next day. If this approach doesn\'t \nfit your campaign, consider the following variants. \nEPIC HEROISM \nThis variant uses a short rest of 5 minutes and a long \nrest of 1 hour. This change makes combat more routine, \nsince characters can easily recover from every battle. \nYou might want to make combat encounters more \ndifficult to compensate. \nSpellcasters using this system can afford to burn \nthrough spell slots quickly, especially at higher levels. \nConsider allowing spellcasters to restore expended \nspell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots \n(rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to limit \nspell slots restored to 5th level or lower. Only a full \n8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to restore all spell \nslots and to regain spell slots of 6th level or higher. \nGRITTY REALISM \nThis variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long \nrest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, \nrequiring the players to carefully judge the benefits \nand drawbacks of combat. Characters can\'t afford to \nengage in too many battles in a row. and all adventuring \nrequires careful planning. \nThis approach encourages the characters to \nspend time out of the dungeon. It" a good option for \ncampaigns that emphasize intrigue. politics. and \ninteractions among other PCs. and in which combat is \nrare or something to be avoided rather rhan rushed into. \nFIREARMS \nIf you want to model the swa hbuckling r.yle of \nThe Three Musketeers and imilar tale . you can \nintroduce gunpowder weapon ro your campaign that \nare associated with the Renaissance. imilarly. in a \ncampaign where a space hip h \nera bed or elements \nof modern-day Earth are pre en . fu uri tic or modern \nfirearms might appear. The Firearms table provides \nexamples of firearms from all three of those periods. \nThe modern and futuristic items are priceless. \nPROFICIENCY \nIt\'s up to you to decide whether a character has \nproficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&amp;D \nworlds wouldn\'t have such proficiency. During their \ndowntime, characters can use the training ru les in the \nPlayer\'s Handbook to acquire proficiency, assuming \nthat they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons \nworking while mastering their use. \nPROPERTIES \nFirearms use special ammunition, and some of them \nhave the burst fire or reload property. \nAmmunition. The ammunition of a firearm is \ndestroyed upon use. Renaissance and modern firearms \nuse bullets. Futuristic firearms are powered by a \nspecial type of ammunition called energy cells. An \nenergy cell contains enough power for all the shots its \nfirearm can make. \nBurst Fire. A weapon that has the burst fire property \ncan make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a \n10-foot-cube area within normal range with shots. Each \ncreature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity \nsaving throw or take the weapon\'s normal damage. This \naction uses ten pieces of ammunition. \nReload. A limited number of shots can be made with \na weapon that has the reload property. A character must \nthen reload it using an action or a bonus action (the \ncharacter\'s choice). \nEXPLOSIVES \nA campaign might include explosives from the \nRenaissance or the modern world (the latter are \npriceless), as presented in the Explosives table. \nBOMB \nAs an action, a character can light this bomb and throw \nit at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 \nfeet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity \nsaving throw or take 3d6 fire damage. \nGUNPOWDER \nGunpowder is chiefly used to propel a bu 11et out of the \nbarrel of a pistol or rifle, or it is formed into a bomb. \nGunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs and in water-\nresistant powder horns. \nSetting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause \nit to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within \n10 feet of it (3d6 for a powder horn, 7d6 for a keg). A \nsuccessful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the \ndamage. Setting fire to an ounce of gunpowder causes \nit to flare for 1 round, shedding bright light in a 30-foot \nradius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. \nDYNAMITE \nAs an action, a creature can light a stick of dynamite \nand throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature \nwithin 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity \nsaving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a \nfailed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER\'S WORKSHOP \n'},

  'text': "A character can bind sticks of dynamite together so \nthey explode at the same time. Each additional stick \nincreases the damage by 1d6 (to a maximum of 10d6) \nand the burst radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet). \nALIEN TECHNOLOGY \nWhen adventurers find a piece of technology that isn't \nfrom their world or time period, the players might \nunderstand what the object is, but the characters \nrarely will. To simulate a character's ignorance about \nthe technology, have the character make a series of \nIntelligence checks to figure it out. \nDynamite can be rigged with a longer fuse to explode \nafter a set amount of time, usually 1 to 6 rounds. Roll \ninitiative for the dynamite. After the set number of \nrounds goes by, the dynamite explodes on that initiative. \nTo determine how the technology works, a character \nmust succeed on a number of Intelligence checks \nbased on the complexity of the item: two successes for \na simple item (such as a cigarette lighter, calculator, or \nrevolver) and four successes for a complex item (such a \na computer, chainsaw, or hovercraft). Then consult the \nFiguring Out Alien Technology table. Consider making \nthe item break if a character fails four or more times \nbefore taking a long rest. \nGRENADES \nAs an action, a character can throw a grenade at a \npoint up to 60 feet away.

  'text': "PLOT POINTS \nPlot points allow players to change the course of the \ncampaign, introduce plot complications, alter the \nworld, and even assume the role of the DM. If your first \nreaction to reading this optional rule is to worry that \nyour players might abuse it, it's probably not for you. \nUSING PLOT POINTS \nEach player starts with 1 plot point. During a session, \na player can spend that point for one effect. The effect \ndepends on your group's approach to this optional rule. \nThree options are presented below. \nA player can spend no more than 1 plot point \nper session. You can increase this limit if you like, \nespecially if you want the players to drive more of the \nstory. Once every player at the table has spent a plot \npoint, they each gain 1 plot point. \nOPTION 1: WHAT A TWIST! \nA player who spends a plot point gets to add some \nelement to the setting or situation that the group \n(including you) must accept as true. For example, a \nplayer can spend a plot point and state that his or her \ncharacter has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or \na monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed \ninto a horrid beast. \nA player who wants to spend a plot point in this way \nshould take a minute to discuss his or her idea with \neveryone else at the table and get feedback before \nsettling on a plot development. \nOPTION 2: THE PLOT THICKENS \nWhenever a player spends a plot point, the player to his \nor her right must add a complication to the scene. For \nexample, if the player who spends the plot point decides \nthat her character has found a secret door, the player \nto the right might state that opening the door triggers a \nmagical trap that teleports the party to another part of \nthe dungeon. \nOPTION 3: THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY \nWith this approach, there is no permanent DM. \nEveryone makes a character, and one person starts as \nthe DM and runs the game as normal. That person's \ncharacter becomes an NPC who can tag along with the \ngroup or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes. \nAt any time, a player can spend a plot point to become \nthe DM. That player's character becomes an NPC, and \nplay continues. It's probably not a good idea to swap \nroles in the middle of combat, but it can happen if your \ngroup allows time for the new DM to settle into his or \nher role and pick up where the previous DM left off. \nUsing plot points in this way can make for an \nexciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in \nunexpected directions. This approach is also a great \nway for would-be DMs to try running a game in small, \ncontrolled doses. \nIn a campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone \nshould come to the table with a bit of material prepared \nor specific encounters in mind. A player who isn't \nprepared or who doesn't feel like DMing can choose \nto not spend a plot point that session. \n"},

  'text': "For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish \nsome shared assumptions about the campaign so that \nDMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each \nother's plans. \nCOMBAT OPTIONS \nThe options in this section provide alternative ways to \nhandle combat. The main risk of adding some of these \nrules is slowing down play. \nINITIATIVE VARIANTS \n----\nThis section offers different ways to handle initiative. \nINITIATIVE ScoRE \n• With this optional rule, creature don't roll initiative \nat the start of combat. Instead, each creature has an \ninitiative score, which is a passive Dexterity check: \n10 +Dexterity modifier. \nBy cutting down on die rolls, math done on the fly, \nand the process of asking for and recording totals, you \ncan speed your game up considerably-at the cost of an \ninitiative order that is often predictable. \nSIDE INITIATIVE \nRecording initiative for each PC and monster, arrangin \neveryone in the correct order, and remembering where \nyou are in the list can bog the game down. If you want \nquicker combats, at the risk of those combats becoming \nunbalanced, try using the side initiative rule. \nUnder this variant, the players roll a d20 for their \ninitiative as a group, or side. You also roll a d20. Neither \nroll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins \ninitiative. In case of a tie, keep rerolling until the tie \nis broken. \nWhen it's a side's turn, the members of that side can \nact in any order they choose. Once everyone on the side \nhas taken a turn, the other side goes. A round ends \nwhen both sides have completed their turns. \nIf more than two sides take part in a battle, each side \nrolls for initiative. Sides act from the highest roll to \nlowest. Combat continues in the initiative order until the \nbattle is complete. \nThis variant encourages teamwork and makes your \nlife as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate \nmonsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative \ncan gang up on enemies and take them out before they \nhave a chance to act. \nSPEED FACTOR \nSome DMs find the regular progression of initiative \ntoo predictable and prone to abuse. Players can use \ntheir knowledge of the initiative order to influence their \ndecisions. For example, a badly wounded fighter might \ncharge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes \nbefore the monster and can heal him. \nSpeed factor is an option for initiative that introduces \nmore uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of \nplay. Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll \ninitiative each round. Before rolling, each character or \nmonster must choose an action. \n"},

  'text': "Initiative Modifiers. Modifiers might apply to a \n-eature's initiative depending on its size and the action \n- rakes. For example, a creature that fights with a light \neapon or casts a simple spell is more likely to act \nfore a creature armed with a heavy or slow weapon. \n:ee the Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers table for \n: rails. If an action has no modifier listed, the action has \n-\neffect on initiative. If more than one modifier applies \nsuch as wielding a two-handed, heavy melee weapon), \n.ipply them all to the initiative roll. \nSPEED FACTOR INITIATIVE MODIFIERS \nractor \nSpellcasting \n.1elee, heavy weapon \nelee, light or finesse weapon \nelee, two-handed weapon \n~an ged, loading weapon \nCreature Size \n- iny \nSmall \n.1edium \n_arge \n-l uge \nGargantuan \nInitiative Modifier \nSubtract the spell's level \n- 2 \n+2 \n-2 \n-5 \nInitiative Modifier \n+5 \n+2 \n+0 \n-2 \n-5 \n- 8 \nDon't apply the same modifier more than once on a \ncreature's turn. For example, a rogue fighting with two \ndaggers gains the +2 bonus for using a light or finesse \nweapon only once. In the case of spellcasting, apply only \nthe modifier from the highest-level spell. \nApply any modifiers for bonus actions to that \ncreature's turn, remembering never to apply the \nsame modifier twice. For instance, a paladin casts a \n2nd-level spell as a bonus action and then attacks with a \n-hortsword. The paladin takes a -2 penalty for the spell \nand gains a +2 bonus for using a light weapon, for a total \nmodifier of +0. \nThe table is only a starting point. You can refer to it \nwhen adjudicating any actions a character takes that \nyou think should be faster or slower. Quick, easy actions \nhould grant a bonus, while slow, difficult ones should \nincur a penalty. As a rule of thumb, apply a bonus or \npenalty of 2 or 5 for an action. \nFor example, a fighter wants to turn a winch to raise a \nportcullis. This is a complex, difficult action. You could \nrule that it incurs a -5 initiative penalty. \nRolling Initiative. After deciding on an action, \neveryone rolls initiative and applies modifiers, keeping \nrhe result secret. You then announce an initiative \nnumber, starting with 30 and working down (it helps to \ncall out ranges of numbers at the start). Break any ties \nby having the combatant with the highest Dexterity act \nfirst. Otherwise, roll to determine who goes first. \nTurns. On its turn, a creature moves as normal but \nmust take the action it selected or take no action at all. \nOnce everyone has acted, the process repeats. \nEveryone in the battle selects an action. rolls initiative, \nand takes turns in order. \nACTION OPTIONS \nThis section provides new action options for combat. \nThey can be added as a group or individually to \nyour game. \nCLIMB ONTO A BIGGER CREATURE \nIf one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it \ncan do so by grappling. A Small or Medium creature has \nlittle chance of making a successful grapple against a \nHuge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic \nhas granted the grappler supernatural might. \nAs an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be \ntreated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its \nback or clinging to a limb. After making any ability \nchecks necessary to get into position and onto the larger \ncreature, the smaller creature uses its action to make \na Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check \ncontested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. \nIf it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully \nmoves into the target creature's space and clings to its \nbody. While in the target's space, the smaller creature \nmoves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls \nagainst it. \nThe smaller creature can move around within the \nlarger creature's space, treating the space as difficult \nterrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the \nsmaller creature depends on the smaller creature's \nlocation, and is left to your discretion. The larger \ncreature can dislodge the smaller creature as an \naction- knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, \nor grabbing and throwing it- by making a Strength \n(Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's \nStrength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. \nThe smaller creature chooses which ability to use. \nDISARM \nA creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon \nor another item from a target's grasp. The attacker \nmakes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength \n(Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the \nattacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage \nor other ill effect, but the defender drops the item. \nThe attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if \nthe target is holding the item with two or more hands. \nThe target has advantage on its ability check if it is \nlarger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it \nis smaller. \nMARK \nThis option makes it easier for melee combatants to \nharry each other with opportunity attacks. \nWhen a creature makes a melee attack, it can also \nmark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, \nany opportunity attack it makes against the marked \ntarget has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't \nexpend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't \nmake the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated \ncondition or the shocking grasp spell, is preventing it \nfrom taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one \nopportunity attack per turn. \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \n"},

  'text': "OVERRUN \nWhen a creature tries to move through a hostile \ncreature's space, the mover can try to force its way \nthrough by overrunning the hostile creature. As an \naction or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength \n(Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's \nStrength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the \noverrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than \nthe hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If \nthe mover wins the contest, it can move through the \nhostile creature's space once this turn. \nSHOVE ASIDE \nWith this option, a creature uses the special shove \nattack from the Player's Handbook to force a target \nto the side, rather than away. The attacker has \ndisadvantage on its Strength (Athletics) check when it \ndoes so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves \nthe target 5 feet to a different space within its reach. \nTUMBLE \nA creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's \nspace, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an \naction or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity \n(Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature's \nDexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the \ncontest, it can move through the hostile creature's space \nonce this turn. \nHITTING COVER \nWhen a ranged attack misses a target that has cover, \nyou can use this optional rule to determine whether the \ncover was struck by the attack. \nFirst, determine whether the attack roll would have \nhit the protected target without the cover. If the attack \nroll falls within a range low enough to miss the target \nbut high enough to strike the target if there had been \nno cover, the object used for cover is struck. If a creature \nis providing cover for the missed creature and the \nattack roll exceeds the AC of the covering creature, the \ncovering creature is hit. \nCLEAVING THROUGH CREATURES \nIf your player characters regularly fight hordes of lower-\nlevel monsters, consider using this optional rule to help \nspeed up such fights. \nWhen a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature \nto 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack \nmight carry over to another creature nearby. The \nattacker targets another creature within reach and, if \nthe original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining \ndamage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is \nlikewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, \ncarrying over the remaining damage until there are no \nvalid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to \nreduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points. \nINJURIES ___ \n_ \nDamage normally leaves no lingering effects. This \noption introduces the potential for long-term injuries. \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \nIt's up to you to decide when to check for a lingering \ninjury. A creature might sustain a lingering injury under \nthe following circumstances: \nWhen it takes a critical hit \nWhen it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright \nWhen it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more \nTo determine the nature of the injury, roll on the \nLingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical \nhumanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for \ncreatures with different body types. \nLINGERING INJURIES \nd20 \nInjury \nLose an Eye. You have disadvantage on Wisdom \n(Perception) checks that rely on sight and on \nranged attack rolls. Magic such as the regenerate \nspell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes \nleft after sustaining this injury, you're blinded. \n2 \nLose an Arm or a Hand. You can no longer hold \nanything with two hands, and you can hold only a \nsingle object at a time. Magic such as the regenerate \nspell can restore the lost appendage. \n3 \nLose a Foot or Leg. Your speed on foot is halved, \nand you must use a cane or crutch to move unless \nyou have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall \nprone after using the Dash action. You have \ndisadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. \nMagic such as the regenerate spell can restore the \nlost appendage. \n4 \nLimp. Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You \nmust make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after \nusing the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall \nprone. Magical healing removes the limp. \n5-7 \nInternal Injury. Whenever you attempt an action \nin combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution \nsaving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action \nand can't use reactions until the start of your next \nturn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing \nor if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting. \n8-10 \nBroken Ribs. This has the same effect as Internal \nInjury above, except that the save DC is 10. \n11-13 \nHorrible Scar. You are disfigured to the extent that \nthe wound can't be easily concealed. You have \ndisadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks \nand advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. \nMagical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal \nand regenerate, removes the scar. \n14-16 \nFestering Wound. Your hit point maximum is \nreduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. \nIf your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. \nThe wound heals if you receive magical healing. \nAlternatively, someone can tend to the wound and \nmake a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every \n24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. \n17-20 \nMinor Scar. The scar doesn't have any adverse \neffect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such \nas heal and regenerate, removes the scar. \n"},

  'text': "Instead of using the effect described in the table, you \ncan put the responsibility of representing a character's \nlingering injury in the hands of the player. Roll on the \nLingering Injuries table as usual, but instead of suffering \nthe effect described for that result, that character gains \na new flaw with the same name. It's up to the player to \nexpress the lingering injury during play, just like any \nother flaw, with the potential to gain inspiration when \nthe injury affects the character in a meaningful way. \nMASSIVE DAMAGE \nThis optional rule makes it easier for a creature to be \nfelled by massive damage. \nWhen a creature takes damage from a single source \nequal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it \nmust succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw \nor suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the \nSystem Shock table. For example, a creature that has a \nhit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution \nsave if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source. \nSYSTEM SHOCK \ndlO \nEffect \nThe creature drops to 0 hit points. \n2-3 \nThe creature drops to 0 hit points but is stable. \n4-5 \nThe creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. \n6-7 \nThe creature can't take reactions and has \ndisadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until \nthe end of its next turn. \n8-10 \nThe creature can't take reactions unti l the end of its \nnext turn. \nMORALE \nSome combatants might run away when a fight turns \nagainst them. You can use this optional rule to help \ndetermine when monsters and NPCs flee. \nA creature might flee under any of the following \ncircumstances: \n• The creature is surprised. \nThe creature is reduced to half its hit points or fewer \nfor the first time in the battle. \nThe creature has no way to harm the opposing side \non its turn. \nA group of creatures might flee under any of the \nfollowing circumstances: \nAll the creatures in the group are surprised. \nThe group's leader is reduced to 0 hit points, \nincapacitated, taken prisoner, or removed from battle. \n• The group is reduced to half its original size with no \nlosses on the opposing side. \nTo determine whether a creature or group of \ncreatures flees, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw \nfor the creature or the group's leader. If the opposition \nis overwhelming, the saving throw is made with \ndisadvantage, or you can decide that the save fails \nautomatically. If a group's leader can't make the saving \nthrow for whatever reason, have the creature in the \ngroup with the next highest Charisma score make the \nsaving throw instead. \nOn a failed save, the affectedereature or group flees \nby the most expeditious route. If escape is impossible, \nthe creature or group surrenders. If a creature or group \nthat surrenders is attacked by its conquerors, the battle \nmight resume, and it's unlikely that further attempts to \nflee or surrender will be made. \nA failed saving throw isn't always to the adventurers' \nbenefit. For example, an ogre that flees from combat \nmight put the rest of the dungeon on alert or run off with \ntreasure that the characters had hoped to plunder. \nCREATING A MONSTER \nThe Monster Manual contains hundreds of ready-to-play \nmonSters, but it doesn't include every monster that you \ncan imagine. Part of the D&amp;D experience is the simple \njoy of creating new monsters and customizing existing \nones, if for no other reason than to surprise and delight \nyour players with something they've never faced before. \nThe first step in the process is coming up with the \nconcept for your monster. What makes it unique? Where \ndoes it live? What role do you want it to serve in your \nadventure, your campaign, or your world? What does \nit look like? Does it have any weird abilities? Once you \nhave the answers to these questions, you can start \nfiguring out how to represent your monster in the game. \nMODIFYING A MONSTER \nOnce you have an idea for a monster, you'll need \nstatistics to represent it. The first question you should \nask yourself is: Can I use statistics that already exist? \nA stat block in the Monster Manual might make a \ngood starting point for your monster. Imagine, for \nexample, that you want to create an intelligent arboreal \npredator that hunts elves. There is no such monster \nin the Monster Manual, but the quaggoth is a savage \nhumanoid predator with a climbing speed. You could \nborrow the quaggoth stat block for your new monster, \nchanging nothing but the creature's name. You can also \nmake minor tweaks, such as replacing the quaggoth's \nlanguage, Undercommon, with one that's more \nappropriate, such as Elvish or Sylvan. \nNeed a fiery phoenix? Take the giant eagle or roc, give \nit immunity to fire, and allow it to deal fire damage with \nits attacks. Need a flying monkey? Consider a baboon \nwith wings and a flying speed. Almost any monster you \ncan imagine can be built using one that already exists. \nAdapting a stat block is far less time-consuming than \ncreating one from scratch, and there are changes you \ncan make to an existing monster that have no effect \non its challenge rating, such as swapping languages, \nchanging its alignment, or adding special senses. \nHowever, once you change the creature's offensive or \ndefensive ability, such as its hit points or damage, its \nchallenge rating might need to change, as shown later. \nSWITCHING WEAPONS \nIf a monster wields a manufactured weapon, you can \nreplace that weapon with a different one. For example, \nyou could replace a hobgoblin's longsword with a \nhalberd. Don't forget to change the damage and the \nattack's reach where appropriate. Also be aware of the \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \n273 \n"},

Familiarize \nyourself with that material before you begin. In the \ncourse of creating your monster, if you find yourself \nunable to make a decision, let the examples in the \nMonster Manual guide you. \nOnce you have a monster concept in mind, follow the \nsteps below. \nSTEP 1. N A ME \nA monster\'s name should be given as much \nconsideration as any other aspect of the monster, \nif not more. \nYour monster might be based on a real-world creature \nor a monster from myth, in which case its name might \nbe obvious. If you need to invent a name, keep in \nmind that the best names either reflect the monster\'s \nappearance or nature (such as the mimic and the \nowlbear) or have a nice ring to them (such as the chuul \nand the thri-kreen). \nSTEP 2. SIZE \nMak6 your monster whatever size you want: Tiny, Small, \nMedium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. \nA monster\'s size determines which die is used to \ncalculate its hit points in step 8. Size also determines \nhow much space the monster occupies, as discussed in \nthe Player\'s Handbook. \nSTEP 3. T YPE \nA monster\'s type provides insight into its origins and \nnature. The Monster Manual describes each monster \ntype. Choose the type that best fits your concept for \nthe monster. \nSTEP 4. ALIGNMENT \nIf your monster has no concept of morals, it is \nunaligned. Otherwise, it has an alignment appropriate \nto its nature and moral outlook, as discussed in the \nPlayer\'s Handbook. \nSTEP 5. ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS \nMonsters, like player characters, have the six ability \nscores. A monster can\'t have a score lower than 1 or \nhigher than 30 in any ability. \nA monster\'s score in any ability determines its ability \nmodifier, as shown in the Ability Scores and Modifiers \ntable in the Player\'s Handbook. \nIf you can\'t decide what a monster\'s ability scores \nshould be, look for comparable monsters in the Monster \nManual and mimic their ability scores. For example, \nif your monster is roughly as smart as a human \ncommoner, give it an Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier). \nIf it\'s as strong as an ogre, give it a Strength of 19 (+4 \nmodifier). \nSTEP 6. EXPECTED CHALLENGE R ATING \nChoose a challenge rating for your monster. See step \n1 under "Creating Quick Monster Stats" for more \ninformation. You will use the proficiency bonus in later \nsteps, so jot it down now or remember it. \nSTEP 7. ARMOR CLASS \nA monster\'s Armor Class has a direct bearing on its \nchallenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine your \nmonster\'s Armor Class in one of two ways. \nUse the Table. You can choose an appropriate AC \nbased on the monster\'s expected challenge rating, as \nshown in the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating \ntable. The table provides the baseline AC for a monster \nof a specific challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the \nAC as you see fit. For example, the baseline AC for a \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER\'S WORKSHOP \n~75 \n'},

Don\'t worry if \nthe monster\'s AC isn\'t matching up with the expected \nchallenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affec· \na monster\'s challenge rating, as shown in later steps. \nDetermine an Appropriate AC. Alternatively, you car: \ndetermine an appropriate AC based on the type of arm -\nthe monster wears, its natural armor, or some other \nArmor Class booster (such as the mage armor spell). \nAgain, don\'t worry if the monster\'s AC isn\'t matching u \nwith the expected challenge rating for the monster. \nIf your monster wears manufactured armor, its \nArmor Class is based on the type of armor worn (see \nthe Player\'s Handbook for armor types). If the monster \ncarries a shield, apply the shield bonus to its AC \nas normal. \nA monster that doesn\'t wear armor might have natur2 \narmor, in which case it has an AC equal to 10 +its \nDexterity modifier+ its natural armor bonus.

A gorgon, for example. \nis covered in steely plates and has a natural armor \nbonus of+9. \nSTEP 8. HIT POINTS \nA monster\'s hit points have a direct bearing on its \nchallenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine y \n-\nmonster\'s hit points in one of two ways. \nUse the Table. You can start with the monster\'s \nexpected challenge rating and use the Monster \nStatistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an \nappropriate number of hit points. The table presents a \nrange of hit points for each challenge rating. \nAssign Hit Dice. Alternatively, you can assign a \nnumber of Hit Dice to a monster, then calculate its \naverage hit points. Don\'t worry if the hit points aren t \nmatching up with the expected challenge rating for the \nmonster. Other factors can affect a monster\'s challenge \nrating, as shown in later steps, and you can always \nadjust a monster\'s Hit Dice and hit points later on. \nA monster can have as many Hit Dice as you want. \nbut the size of the die used to calculate its hit points \ndepends on the monster\'s size, as shown in the Hit Di \nby Size table.

  'text': 'STEP 9. DAMAGE VuL "ER..\'\\BILITIES , \nRESISTANCES, AND hnn ; . "ITIE \nDecide whether your mon ter ha \\·ulnerability, \nresistance, or immunity to one or more types of \ndamage (see the Players Handbook for descriptions \nof the various damage types). . \nign a vulnerability, \nresistance, or immunity to a mon ter only when it\'s \nintuitive. For example, it make \nen e for a monster \nmade of molten lava to have immunity to fire damage. \nGiving a monster resistances and immunities to three \nor more damage types (especially bludgeoning, piercing, \nand slashing damage) is like gi\\·ing it extra hit points. \nHowever, adventurers have more resources at higher \nlevels to counteract such defense . making resistances \nand immunities less relevant at higher levels. \nEffective Hit Points. If a monster has resistance \nor immunity to several damage types- especially \nbludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from \nnonmagical weapons-and not all the characters in the \nparty possess the means to counteract that resistance \nor immunity, you need to take these defenses into \naccount when comparing your monster\'s hit points to its \nexpected challenge rating. Using the Effective Hit Points \nBased on Resistances and Immunities table, apply \nthe appropriate multiplier to the monster\'s hit points \nto determine its effective hit points for the purpose of \ngauging its final challenge rating. (The monster\'s actual \nhit points shouldn\'t change.) \nFor example, a monster with an expected \nchallenge rating of 6, 150 hit points, and resistance \nto bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from \nnonmagical weapons effectively has 225 hit points \n(using the 1.5 multiplier for resistances) for the purpose \nof gauging its final challenge rating. \nMonsters don\'t normally have vulnerability to more \nthan one or two types of damage. Vulnerabilities don\'t \nsignificantly affect a monster\'s challenge rating, unless \na monster has vulnerabilities to multiple damage types \nthat are prevalent, especially bludgeoning, piercing, \nand slashing. For such a strange monster, reduce its \neffective hit points by half. Or even better, eliminate \nthe vulnerabilities and give the brittle monster fewer \nhit points. \nEFFECTIVE HIT POINTS BASED ON \nRESISTANCES AND IMMUNITIES \nExpected \nHP Multiplier for \nHP Multiplier for \nChallenge Rating \nResistances \nImmunities \n1-4 \nx2 \nx 2 \n5-10 \nX 1.5 \nx2 \n11-16 \nX 1.25 \nX 1.5 \n17 or more \nX 1 \nX 1.25 \nSTEP 10. ATTACK BONUSES \nA monster\'s attack bonuses have a direct bearing on its \nchallenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a \nmonster\'s attack bonuses in one of two ways. \nUse the Table. You can start with the monster\'s \nexpected challenge rating and use the Monster \nStatistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an \nappropriate attack bonus for all the monster\'s attacks, \nregardless of its ability scores. \nThe table provides the baseline attack bonus for each \nchallenge rating. Feel free to adjust the attack bonus as \nyou see fit to match whatever concept you have in mind. \nFor example, the baseline attack bonus for a challenge \nrating 1 monster is +3, but if your monster needs more \naccuracy, raise its bonus accordingly. Don\'t worry if \nthe monster\'s attack bonus isn\'t matching up with the \nexpected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors \ncan affect a monster\'s challenge rating, as shown in \nlater steps. \nCalculate Attack Bonuses. Alternatively, you can \ncalculate a monster\'s attack bonuses the same way \nplayers calculate the attack bonuses of a character. \nWpen a monster has an action that requires an attack \nroll, its attack bonus is equal to its proficiency bonus+ \nits Strength or Dexterity modifier. A monster usually \napplies its Strength modifier to melee attacks and its \nDexterity modifier to ranged attacks, although smaller \nmonsters sometimes use Dexterity for both. \nAgain, don\'t worry if the attack bonuses aren\'t \nmatching up with the expected challenge rating for \nthe monster. You can always adjust a monster\'s attack \nbonuses later. \nSTEP 11. DAMAGE \nA monster\'s damage output- the amount of damage it \ndeals every round-has a direct bearing on its challenge \nrating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster\'s \ndamage output in one of two ways. \nUse the Table. You can start with the monster\'s \nexpected challenge rating and use the Monster \nStatistics by Challenge Rating table to determine how \nmuch damage the monster should deal every round. \nThe table presents a range at each challenge rating. \nIt doesn\'t matter how this damage is apportioned or \ndistributed; for example, a monster might deal the \ndamage every round with a single attack, or the damage \ncould be split among multiple attacks against one or \nmore foes. \nChoose the type of damage based on how you imagine \nthe damage being delivered. For example, if the monster \nis attacking with razor-sharp claws, the damage it deals \nis probably slashing damage. If its claws are poisonous, \nsome portion of the damage might be poison damage \ninstead of slashing damage. \nIf you want the damage output to vary slightly from \nround to round, you can translate the damage range into \na single die expression (for a monster with one attack) \nor multiple die expressions (for a monster with multiple \nattacks). For example, a challenge rating 2 monster \ndeals 15- 20 damage per round. If you imagine the \ncreature having a Strength of 18 (+4 modifier), you could \ngive it one melee attack that deals 3d8 + 4 (average \n17.5) damage, split the damage output into two separate \nattacks that deal1d10 + 4 (average 9) damage each; or \nuse any other combination where the average damage \noutput falls within the desired range. \nBase the Damage on the Weapon. Alternatively, \nyou can use a die expression to represent the damage \nthat a monster deals with each of its attacks based on \nwhatever weapon it is using. \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER\'S WORKSHOP \n'},

  'text': "I, \nDon't worry if the damage output isn't matching up \nwith the expected challenge rating for the monster. \nOther factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, \nas will be discussed in later steps, and you can always \nadjust a monster's damage output later on. \nSome monsters use natural weapons, such as claws \nor tail spikes. Others wield manufactured weapons. \nIf a monster has natural weapons, you decide how \nmuch damage it deals with those attacks, as well as the \ntype of damage. See the Monster Manual for examples. \nIf a monster wields a manufactured weapon, it deals \ndamage appropriate to the weapon. For example, a \ngreataxe in the hands of a Medium monster deals ld12 \nslashing damage plus the monster's Strength modifier, \nas is normal for that weapon. \nBig monsters typically wield oversized weapons that \ndeal extra dice of damage on a hit. Double the weapon \ndice if the creature is Large, triple the weapon dice if it's \nHuge, and quadruple the weapon dice if it's Gargantuan. \nFor example, a Huge giant wielding an appropriately \nsized greataxe deals 3dl2 slashing damage (plus its \nStrength bonus), instead of the normalldl2. \nA creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a \nweapon that is sized for a larger attacker. You can rule \nthat a weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes \nlarger is too big for the creature to use at all. \nOverall Damage Output. To determine a monster's \noverall damage output, take the average damage it \ndeals with each of its attacks in a round and add them \ntogether. If a monster has different attack options, use \nthe monster's most effective attacks to determine its \ndamage output. For example, a fire giant can make two \ngreatsword attacks or one rock attack in a round. The \ngreatsword attacks deal more damage, so that attack \nroutine determines the fire giant's damage output. \nIf a monster's damage output varies from round to \nround, calculate its damage output each round for the \nfirst three rounds of combat, and take the average. \nFor example, a young white dragon has a multiattack \nroutine (one bite attack and two claw attacks) that deals \nan average of 37 damage each round, as well as a breath \nweapon that deals 45 damage, or 90 if it hits two targets \n(and it probably will). In the first three rounds of combat, \nthe dragon will probably get to use its breath weapon \nonce and its multiattack routine twice, so its average \ndamage output for the first three rounds would be (90 + \n37 + 37) + 3, or 54 damage (rounded down). \nWhen calculating a monster's damage output, also \naccount for special off-turn damage-dealing features, \nsuch as auras, reactions, legendary actions, or lair \nATTACK RIDERS \nMany monsters have attacks that do more than deal damage. \nSome effects that can be added to an attack to give it a \nflavorful twist include: \n• Adding damage of a different type to the attack \n• Having the monster grapple the target on a hit \n• Allowing the monster to knock the target prone on a hit \n• Imposing a condition on the target if the attack hits and \nthe target fails a saving throw \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \nactions. For example, a balor's Fire Aura deals 10 \nfire damage to any creature that hits the balor with a \nmelee attack. The aura also deals 10 fire damage to all \ncreatures within 5 feet of the balor at the start of each \nof the balor's turns. If you assume that one character ~ \nthe party is within 5 feet of the balor at all times, hittir::; \nit with a melee weapon every round, then the balor's \ndamage output per round increases by 20. \nSTEP 12. SAVE DCs \nA monster might have an attack or some other trait \nthat requires a target to make a saving throw. The sa,·e \nDCs to resist such effects have a direct bearing on the \nmonster's challenge rating, and vice versa. You can \ndetermine save DCs in one of two ways. \nUse the Table. You can start with the monster's \nexpected challenge rating and use the Monster \nStatistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an \nappropriate save DC for any effect that requires a tar e· \nto make a saving throw. \nCalculate the DCs. Alternatively, you can calculate \na monster's save DCs as follows: 8 + the monster's \nproficiency bonus + the monster's relevant ability \nmodifier. You choose the ability that best applies. \nFor example, if the effect is a poison, the relevant \nability is probably the monster's Constitution. If \nthe effect is similar to that of a spell, the relevant \nability might be the monster's Intelligence, Wisdom, \nor Charisma. \nDon't worry if the save DCs aren't matching up with \nthe expected challenge rating for the monster. Other \nfactors can affect a monster's challenge rating, as \nshown in later steps, and you can always adjust the sa -\nDCs later on. \nSTEP 13. SPECIAL TRAITS , ACTIONS, AND \nREACTIONS \nSome special traits (such as Magic Resistance), specia:. \nactions (such as· Superior Invisibility), and special \nreactions (such as Parry) can improve a monster's \ncombat effectiveness and potentially increase its \nchallenge rating. \n"},

The table \nnotes which features increase a monster\'s effective \nArmor Class, hit points, attack bonus. or damage output \nfor the purpose of determining its challenge rating. (The \nfeatures don\'t actually change the monster\'s statistics-) \nFeatures that have no effect on a monster\'s challenge \nrating are noted with a dash (-)-\nWhen assigning special traits, actions, or reactions \nto a monster, keep in mind that not all monsters need \nthem. The more you add, the more complex (and harder \nto run) the monster becomes. \nInnate Spellcasting and Spellcasting. The impact \nthat the Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting special \ntraits have on a monster\'s challenge rating depends \non the spells that the monster can cast Spells that \ndeal more damage than the monster\'s normal attack \nroutine and spells that increase the monster\'s AC or \nhit points need to be accounted for when determining \nthe monster\'s final challenge rating. See the "Special \nTraits" section in the introduction of the Monster \nManual for more information on these two special traits. \nSTEP 14. SPEED \nEvery monster has a walking speed. (Immobile \nmonsters have a walking speed of 0 feet) In addition to \nits walking speed, a monster might have one or more \nother speeds, including a burrowing, climbing, flying, or \nswimming speed. \nFlying Monster. Increase the monster\'s effective \nArmor Class by 2 (not its actual A C) if it can fly and deal \ndamage at range and if its expected challenge rating \nis 10 or lower (higher-level characters have a greater \nability to deal with flying creatures). \nSTEP 15. SAVING THROW BONUSES \nIf you want a monster to be unusually resistant to \ncertain kinds of effects, you can give it a bonus to saving \nthrows tied to a particular ability. \nA saving throw bonus is best used to counteract a low \nability score. For example, an undead monster with a \nlow Wisdom score might need a Wisdom saving throw \nbonus to account for the fact that it\'s more difficult to \ncharm, frighten, or turn than its Wisdom would indicate. \nA saving throw bonus is equal to the monster\'s \nproficiency bonus+ the monster\'s relevant \nability modifier. \nA monster with three or more saving throw bonuses \nhas a significant defensive advantage, so its effective AC \n(not its actual AC) should be raised when determining \nits challenge rating. If it has three or four bonuses, \nincrease its effective AC by 2. If it has five or more \nbonuses, increase its effective AC by 4. \nSTEP 16. FINAL CHALLENGE RATING \nAt this point, you have all the statistical information \nyou need to calculate the monster\'s final challenge \nrating. This step is identical to step 4 under "Creating \nQuick Monster Stats." Calculate the monster\'s defensive \nchallenge rating and its offensive challenge rating, then \ntake the average to get its final challenge rating. \nSTEP 17. SKILL BONUSES \nIf you want a monster to be proficient in a skill, you can \ngive it a bonus equal to its proficiency bonus on ability \nchecks related to that skill. For example, a monster \nwith sharp senses might have a bonus on Wisdom \n(Perception) checks, while a duplicitous monster might \nhave a bonus on Charisma (Deception) checks. \nYou can double the proficiency bonus to account for \nheightened mastery. For example, a doppelganger is \nso good at deceiving others that its bonus on Charisma \n(Deception) checks is equal to double its proficiency \nbonus + its Charisma modifier. \nSkill bonuses have no bearing on a monster\'s \nchallenge rating. \nSTEP 18. CONDITION IMMUNITIES \nA monster can be immune to one or more debilitating \nconditions, and these immunities have no bearing on \nits challenge rating. For descriptions of the various \nconditions, see appendix A of the Player\'s Handbook. \nAs with damage immunities, condition immunities \nshould be intuitive and logical. For example, it makes \nsense that a stone golem can\'t be poisoned, since it\'s a \nconstruct without a nervous system or internal organs. \nSTEP 19. SENSES \nA monster might have one or more of the following \nspecial senses, which are described in the Monster \nManual: blindsight, darkvision, tremorsense, and \ntruesight. Whether the monster has special senses or \nnot has no bearing on its challenge rating. \nPassive Perception Score. All monsters have a \npassive Wisdom (Perception) score, which is most \noften used to determine whether a monster detects \napproaching or hidden enemies. A monster\'s passive \nWisdom (Perception) score is 10 + its Wisdom modifier. \nIf the monster has proficiency in the Perception skill, its \nscore is 10 +its Wisdom (Perception) bonus. \nSTEP 20. LANGUAGES \nWhether a monster can speak a language has no \nbearing on its challenge rating. \nA monster can master as many spoken languages as \nyou want, although few monsters know more than one \nor two, and many monsters (beasts in particular) have \nno spoken language whatsoever. A monster that lacks \nthe ability to speak might still understand a language. \nTelepathy. Whether or not a monster has telepathy \nhas no bearing on its challenge rating. For more \ninformation on telepathy, see the Monster Manual. \nNPC STAT BLOCKS \n----------------\nAppendix B of the Monster Manual contains stat blocks \nfor common NPC archetypes such as bandits and \nguards, as well as tips for customizing them. Those tips \ninclude adding racial traits from the Player\'s Handbook, \nequipping NPCs with magic items, and swapping armor, \nweapons, and spells. \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER\'S WORKSHOP \n'},

  'text': 'The NPC Features table summarizes the ability \nmodifiers and features of variou nonhuman races, as \nwell as various creatures from the Monster Manual with \na challenge rating lower than 1. Apply these modifiers \nand add these features to the \nPCs stat block, then \ndetermine the NPC\'s challenge rating just as you would \nfor a monster. Features that can affect a monster\'s \nchallenge rating are listed in the Monster Features table. \nThe NPC\'s proficiency bonus is determined by its level, \njust like a character, rather than by its challenge rating. \nIf the monster you want to use isn\'t listed on the table, \nuse the process described below under "Monsters \nwith Classes." \nMONSTERS WITH CLASSES \nYou can use the rules in chapter 3 of the Player\'s \nHandbook to give class levels to a monster. For example, \nyou can turn an ordinary werewolf into a werewolf with \nfour levels of the barbarian class (such a monster would \nbe expressed as "Werewolf, 4th-level barbarian"). \nStart with the monster\'s stat block. The monster gains \nall the class features for every class level you add, with \nthe following exceptions: \nThe monster doesn\'t gain the starting equipment of \nthe added class. \nFor each class level you add, the monster gains one \nHit Die of its normal type (based on its size), ignoring \nthe class\'s Hit Die progression. \nThe monster\'s proficiency bonus is based on its \nchallenge rating, not its class levels. \nOnce you finish adding class levels to a monster, \nfeel free to tweak its ability scores as you see fit (for \nexample, raising the monster\'s Intelligence score so \nthat the monster is a more effective wizard), and make \nwhatever other adjustments are needed. You\'ll need \nto recalculate its challenge rating as though you had \ndesigned the monster from scratch. \nDepending on the monster and the number of class \nlevels you add to it, its challenge rating might change \nvery little or increase dramatically. For example, a \nwerewolf that gains four barbarian levels is a much \ngreater threat than it was before. In contrast, the hit \npoints, spells, and other class features that an ancient \nred dragon gains from five levels of wizard don\'t \nincrease its challenge rating. \nCREATING A SPELL \nWhen creating a new spell, use existing spells as \nguidelines. Here are some things to consider: \nIf a spell is so good that a caster would want to use it \nall the time, it might be too powerful for its level. \nA long duration or large area can make up for a lesser \neffect, depending on the spell. \nAvoid spells that have very limited use, such as one \nthat works only against good dragons. Though such \na spell could exist in the world, few characters will \nbother to learn or prepare it unless they know in \nadvance that doing so will be worthwhile. \n• Make sure the spell fits with the identity of the class. \nWizards and sorcerers don"t typically have access to \nhealing spells, for example, and adding a healing spell \nto the wizard class list would step on the cleric\'s turf. \nSPELL DAMAGE \n-----------------------------\nFor any spell that deals damage, use the Spell Damage \ntable to determine approximately how much damage is \nappropriate given the spell\'s level. The table assumes \nthe spell deals half damage on a successful saving \nthrow or a missed attack. If your spell doesn\'t deal \ndamage on a successful save, you can increase the \ndamage by 25 percent. \nYou can use different damage dice than the ones \nin the table, provided that the average result is about \nthe same. Doing so can add a little variety to the spell. \nFor example, you could change a cantrip\'s damage \nfrom ldlO (average 5.5) to 2d4 (average 5), reducing \nthe maximum damage and making an average result \nmore likely. \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER \'S WORKSHOP \nI , \n'},

A cantrip \nshouldn\'t offer healing. \nCREATING A MAGIC ITEM \nThe magic items in chapter 7, "Treasure," are but a few \nof the magic treasures that characters can discover \nduring their adventures. If your players are seasoned \nveterans and you want to surprise them, you can either \nmodify an existing item or come up with something new. \nMODIFYING AN ITEM \nThe easiest way to invent a new item is to tweak an \nexisting one. If a paladin uses a flail as her main \nweapon, you could change a holy avenger so that it\'s a \nflail instead of a sword. You can turn a ring of the ram \ninto a wand, or a cloak of protection into a circlet of \nprotection, all without altering the item\'s properties. \nOther substitutions are equally easy. An item that \ndeals damage of one type can easily deal damage of \nanother type. A flame tongue sword could deal lightning \ndamage instead of fire, for example. One capability \ncan replace another, so a potion of climbing can easily \nbecome a potion of stealth. \nYou can also modify an item by fusing it with \nproperties from another item. For example, you could \ncombine the effects of a helm of comprehending \nlanguages with those of a helm of telepathy into a \nsingle helmet. This makes the item more powerful \n(and probably increases its rarity), but it won\'t break \nyour game. \nFinally, remember the tools that are provided for \nmodifying items in chapter 7, "Treasure." Giving an item \nan interesting minor property, a quirk, or sentience can \nalter its flavor significantly. \nCREATING A NEW ITEM \nIf modifying an item doesn\'t quite do the trick, you can \ncreate one from scratch. A magic item should either let a \ncharacter do something he or she couldn\'t do before, or \nimprove the character\'s ability to do something he or she \ncan do already. For example, the ring of jumping lets its \nwearer jump greater distances, thus augmenting what \na character can already do. A ring of the ram, however, \ngives a character the ability to deal force damage. \n'},

  'text': "The simpler your approach. the easier it is for a \ncharacter to use the item in play. Giving the item \ncharges is fine, especially if it ha several different \nabilities, but simply deciding that an item is always \nactive or can be used a fixed number of times per day is \neasier to rna nage. \nPOWER LEVEL \nIf you make an item that lets a character kill whatever \nhe or she hits with it, that item will likely unbalance your \ngame. On the other hand, an item whose benefit rarely \ncomes into play isn't much of a reward and probably not \nworth doling out as one. \nUse the Magic Item Power by Rarity table as a guide \nto help you determine how powerful an item should be, \nbased on its rarity. \nMAGIC ITEM POWER BY RARITY \nRarity \nMax Spell Level \nMax Bonus \nCommon \nl st \nUncommon \n3rd \n+l \nRare \n6th \n+2 \nVery rare \n8th \n+3 \nLegendary \n9th \n+4 \nMaximum Spell Level. This column of the table \nindicates the highest-level spell effect the item should \nconfer, in the form of a once-per-day or similarly limited \nproperty. For example, a common item might confer \nthe benefit of a 1st-level spell once per day (or just once, \nif it's consumable). A rare, very rare, or legendary item \nmight allow its possessor to cast a lower-level spell \nmore frequently. \nMaximum Bonus. If an item delivers a static bonus \nto AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks, this \ncolumn suggests an appropriate bonus based on the \nitem's rarity. \nATTUNEMENT \nDecide whether the item requires a character to be \nattuned to it to use its properties. Use these rules of \nthumb to help you decide: \nIf having all the characters in a party pass an item \naround to gain its lasting benefits would be disruptive, \nthe item should require attunement. \nIf the item grants a bonus that other items also \ngrant, it's a good idea to require attunement so that \ncharacters don't try to collect too many of those items. \nCREATING NEW \nCHARACTER OPTIONS \nIf the options for player characters in the Player's \nHandbook don't meet all the needs of your campaign, \nconsult the following sections for advice on creating \nnew race, class, and background options. \nCREATING A RACE OR SUBRACE ----\nThis section teaches you how to modify existing races, \nas well as create new ones. The most important step in \ncustomizing or designing races for your campaign is \nto start with the story behind the race or subrace you \nwish to create. Having a firm idea of a race's story in \nyour campaign will help you make decisions during the \ncreation process. Ask yourself several questions: \nWhy does my campaign need the race to be playable? \nWhat does the race look like? \nHow would I describe the race's culture? \nWhere do the members of this race live? \nAre there interesting conflicts built into the race's \nhistory and culture that make the race compelling \nfrom a storytelling standpoint? \n• What is the race's relationship to the other \nplayable races? \n• What classes and backgrounds are well suited to \nmembers of the race? \nWhat are the race's signature traits? \n• In the case of a new subrace, what sets it apart from \nthe other subraces of the parent race? \nCompare the race you have in mind with the other \nrace options available to players, to make sure that the \nnew race doesn't pale in comparison to the existing \noptions (which would result in the race being unpopular) \nor completely overshadow them (so that players don't \nfeel as if the other options are inferior). \nWhen the time comes to design the game elements \nof the race, such as its traits, take a look at the game's \nexisting races and let them inspire you. \nCosMETIC ALTERATIONS \nA simple way to modify an existing race is to change \nits appearance. Changes to a race's appearance need \nnot affect its game elements. For example, you could \ntransform halflings into anthropomorphic mice without \nchanging their racial traits at all. \nCULTURAL ALTERATIONS \nIn your world, elves might be desert nomads instead of \nforest dwellers, halflings might live in cloud cities, and \ndwarves might be sailors instead of miners. When you \nchange the culture of a race, you can also make minor \nalterations to the race's proficiencies and traits to reflect \nthat culture. \nFor example, imagine that the dwarves of your world \nare seafarers and inventors of gunpowder. You could \nadd the pistol and musket to the list of weapons that \ndwarves are proficient with, and give them proficiency \nwith waterborne vehicles instead of artisan's tools. \nThese two small changes tell a different story than \nthe default assumptions about dwarves in the Player's \nHandbook, without changing the power level of the race. \nCREATING A NEW SUBRACE \nCreating a new subrace is more involved than making \nsome minor tweaks to existing racial features, but it \ndoes have the advantage of increasing the diversity of \noptions for a particular race, rather than replacing some \noptions with other ones. \nThe following example walks through the creation of \nan elf subrace: the eladrin. This subrace has history in \nthe D&amp;D multi verse, so you already have some stories to \ndraw on when building its traits. \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \n"},

  'text': "286 \nExAMPLE SuBRACE: ELADRIN \nCreatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin \nlive in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities \nsometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing \nbriefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before \nfading back into the Feywild. \nThe elf subraces in the Player's Handbook include \nan ability score increase, a weapon training feature, \nand two or three additional traits. Given the story of \nthe eladrin and their magical nature, an increase to an \neladrin character's Intelligence is appropriate. There's \nno need to alter the basic weapon training shared by \nhigh elves and wood elves. \nAn ability that sets the eladrin apart from other elves \nis their ability to step through the boundary between the \nplanes, disappearing for a moment before reappearing \nsomewhere else. In the game, this is reflected in a \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \nlimited use of the misty step spell. Since misty step is \na 2nd-level spell, this ability is potent enough that the \nsubrace doesn't need additional traits. This leaves us \nwith the following features for the eladrin subrace: \nAbility Score Increase. Your Intelligence score \nincreases by 1. \nElf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the \nlongsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. \nFey Step. You can cast the misty step spell once usin \nthis trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish \na short or long rest. \nCREATING A NEW RACE \nWhen creating a race from scratch, begin with the \nstory and proceed from there. Compare your creation \nto the other races of your world, and borrow freely \nfrom the traits of other races. As an example, consider \nthe aasimar, a race similar to the tiefling but with a \ncelestial heritage. \nEXAMPLE RACE: AASIMAR \nWhereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins, \naasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These \nfolk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrou \nhair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often \nattempt to pass as humans in order to right wrongs and \ndefend goodness on the Material Plane without drawin \nundue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive -\nto fit into society, although they usually rise to the top, \nbecoming revered leaders and honorable heroes. \nYou might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpoin· \nto the tiefling race. The two races could even be at odd \nreflecting some greater conflict between the forces of \ngood and evil in your campaign. \nHere are our basic goals for the aasimar: \n• Aasimar should make effective clerics and paladins. \nAasimar should be to celestials and humans what \ntieflings are to fiends and humans. \nGiven that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of \nthe same coin, the tiefling makes a good starting point \nfor coming up with the new race's traits. Since we wam \naasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it makes \nsense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead o: \nIntelligence and Charisma. \nLike tieflings, aasimar have darkvision. Instead of \nresistance to fire damage, we give them resistance \nto radiant damage to reflect their celestial nature. \nHowever, radiant damage isn't as common as fire \ndamage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage \nas well, making them good at facing undead. \nThe tiefling's Infernal Legacy trait is a good model \nfor a similar trait to reflect a magical, celestial heritage. \nreplacing the tiefling's spells with spells of similar leveL \nthat more closely match the aasimar's celestial ancestrY. \nHowever, the aasimar's expanded resistance might \n-\nrequire limiting this trait to basic utility spells. \nFilling in the remaining details, we end up with the \nfollowing racial traits for the aasimar: \nAbility Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases \nby 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. \n"},

  'text': "Age. Aasimar mature at the arne rate as humans but \nlive a few years longer. \nAlignment. Due to their celestial heritage, aasimar \nare often good. However, some aasimar fall into evil, \nrejecting their heritage. \nSize. Aasimar are built like well-proportioned \nhumans. Your size is Medium. \nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. \nDarkvision. Thanks to your celestial heritage, you \nhave superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You \ncan see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were \nbright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You \ncan't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. \nCelestial Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic \ndamage and radiant damage. \nCelestial Legacy. You know the light can trip. Once \nyou reach 3rd level, you can cast the lesser restoration \nspell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do \nso when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, \nyou can cast the daylight spell once with this trait as a \n3rd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when \nyou finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting \nability for these spells. \nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common \nand Celestial. \nMODIFYING A CLASS \nThe classes in the Player's Handbook capture a wide \nrange of character archetypes, but your campaign world \nmight have need of something more. The following \nsection discusses ways to modify existing classes to \nbetter serve your game's needs. \nCHANGING PROFICIENCIES \nChanging a class's proficiencies is a safe and simple way \nto modify a class to better reflect your world. Swapping \nout one skill or tool proficiency for another doesn't make \na character any stronger or weaker, but doing so can \nchange the flavor of a class in subtle ways. \nFor example, a prominent guild of rogues in your \nworld might worship a patron deity, performing secret \nmissions in that deity's name. To reflect this cultural \ndetail, you could add Religion to the list of skills that a \nrogue character can choose as a proficiency. You could \neven mandate that skill as one of the choices for rogues \nwho belong to this guild. \nYou can also change armor and weapon proficiencies \nto reflect certain aspects of your world. For example, \nyou could decide that the clerics of a particular deity \nbelong to an order that forbids the accumulation of \nmaterial goods, other than magic items useful for their \ndivine mission. Such clerics carry a staff, but they \nare forbidden from wearing armor or using weapons \nother than that staff. To reflect this, you could remove \nthe armor and weapon proficiencies for clerics of this \nfaith, making them proficient with the quarterstaff and \nnothing else. You could give them a benefit to make up \nfor the loss of proficiencies- something like the monk's \nUnarmored Defense class feature, but presented as a \ndivine blessing. \nCHANGING SPELL LISTS \nModifying a class's spell list usually has little effect on \na character's power but can change the flavor of a class \nsignificantly. In your world, paladins might not swear \ntheir oaths to ideals, but instead swear fealty to powerful \nsorcerers. To capture this story concept, you could build \na new paladin spell list with spells meant to protect \ntheir masters, drawn from the sorcerer or wizard lists. \nSuddenly, the paladin feels like a different class. \nBe cautious when changing the warlock spell list. \nSince warlocks regain their spell slots after a short rest, \nthey have the potential to use certain spells more times \nin a day than other classes do. \nRESTRICTING CLASS ACCESS \nWithout changing the way a class functions, you can \nroot it more firmly in the world by associating the class \nwith a particular race or culture. \nFor example, you might decide that bards, sorcerers, \nwarlocks, and wizards represent the magical traditions \nof four different races or cultures. The bardic colleges \nmight be closed to everyone except elves, dragonborn \nmight be the only creatures capable of becoming \nsorcerers, and all warlocks in your world might be \nhuman. You could break that down still further: bards \nof the College of Lore could be high elves, and bards \nof the College of War could be wood elves. Gnomes \ndiscovered the school of illusion, so all wizards who \nspecialize in that school are gnomes. Different human \ncultures produce warlocks with different pacts, and \nso on. Similarly, different cleric domains might reflect \nentirely separate religions associated with different \nraces or cultures. \nYou decide how flexible you want to be in allowing \na player character to break these restrictions. Can a \nhalf-elf live among the elves and study their bardic \ntraditions? Can a dwarf stumble into a warlock pact \ndespite having no connection to a culture that normally \nproduces warlocks? As always, it's better to say yes and \nuse the player's desire as an opportunity to develop the \ncharacter's story and that of your world, rather than \nshutting down possibilities. \nSUBSTITUTING CLASS FEATURES \nIf one or more features of a given class don't exactly \nfit the theme or tone of your campaign, you can pull \nthem out of the class and replace them with new \nones. In doing so, you should strive to make sure \nthat the new options are just as appealing as the \nones you are removing, and that the substitute class \nfeatures contribute to the class's effectiveness at social \ninteraction, exploration, or combat just as well as those \nbeing replaced. \nUltimately, a class exists to help a player express a \nparticular character concept, and any class feature you \nreplace is also removing an aspect of that character. \nSubstituting a class feature should be done only to fit a \nspecific need for your campaign, or to appeal to a player \ntrying to create a specific kind of character (perhaps one \nmodeled after a character from a novel, TV series, comic \nbook, or movie). \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \n"},

  'text': "288 \nThe first step is to figure out what class feature or \ngroup of class features you're going to replace. Then \nyou need to evaluate what each feature provides to the \nclass, so that the features you are adding don't make the \nclass over- or underpowered. Ask yourself the following \nquestions about a feature you're replacing: \nWhat impact does replacing the feature have on \nexploration, social interaction, or combat? \nDoes replacing the feature affect how long the party \ncan continue adventuring in a day? \nDoes the feature consume resources provided \nelsewhere in the class? \nDoes the feature work all the time, or is it regained \nafter a short rest, a long rest, or some other \nlength of time? \nArmed with answers to these questions, you can start \ndesigning new features that replace the ones you are \nremoving. It's fine if the new class features drift closer \nto exploration, social interaction, or combat than the \nones you are replacing, but be wary of going too far. \nFor example, if you replace an exploration-focused \nfeature with something purely combat focused, you've \njust made that class more powerful in combat, and it \ncould overshadow the other classes in a way that you \ndidn't intend. \nThere's no formula that can tell you how to design \nnew class features. The best place to start is by looking \nat other class features, or at spells, feats, or any other \nrules for inspiration. You're almost certainly going to \nhave some missteps, as features that seem good on the \nsurface fall apart in play. That's all right. Everything \nyou design will need to be playtested. When introducing \nnew class features, be sure the players using them are \ncomfortable with the fact that you might need to go back \nand make some changes after seeing them in play., \nCREATING NEW CLASS OPTIONS \nEach class has at least one major choice point. Clerics \nchoose a divine domain, fighters choose a martial \narchetype, wizards choose an arcane tradition, and \nso forth. Creating a new option doesn't require you to \nremove anything from the class, but any new option \nyou add should be compared to existing options to \nmake sure it's no more or less powerful, yet remains \ndistinctive in flavor. Like anything in class design, be \nprepared to playtest your ideas and make changes if \nthings aren't playing out the way you want them to. \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \nOnce you have the concept for the class option in \nmind, it's time to design the specifics. If you're not sure \nwhere to begin, look at the existing options and see w -\nclass features they provide. It's perfectly acceptable for \ntwo class options to have similar features, and it's al o \nfine to look at other classes for examples of mechanics \nyou can draw on for inspiration. As you design each \nclass feature, ask the following questions: \nHow does the class feature reinforce the story or \ntheme of the class option? \nIs there an existing feature that can be used \nas a model? \nHow does the new class feature compare to other \nfeatures of the same level? \nVARIANT: SPELL POINTS \nOne way to modify how a class feels is to change how _ \nuses its spells. With this variant system, a character \\ \nhas the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead \nspell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more \nflexibility, at the cost of greater complexity. \nIn this variant, each spell has a point cost based on - ~ \nlevel. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cosr -\nspell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don·· \nrequire slots and therefore don't require spell points. \nInstead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast you;-\nspells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool \nof spell points instead. You expend a number of spell \npoints to create a spell slot of a given level, and then us~ \nthat slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell po--\ntotal to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell poin -\nwhen you finish a long rest. \nSpells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing-\ncast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each \nlevel of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of · -\nsame level until you finish a long rest. \nThe number of spell points you have to spend is ba \non your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell \nPoints by Level table. Your level also determines the \nmaximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though \nyou might have enough points to create a slot above this \nmaximum, you can't do so. \nThe Spell Points by Level table applies to bards, \nclerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. For a paladin o~ \nranger, halve the character's level in that class and the \nconsult the table. For a fighter (Eidritch Knight) or ro \n(Arcane Trickster), divide the character's level in that \nclass by three. \nThis system can be applied to monsters that cast \nspells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that \nyou do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a \nmonster can be a hassle. \nSPELL POINT COST \nSpell Level \nPoint Cost \nSpell Level \nPoint Cost \nlst \n2 \n5th \n7 \n2nd \n3 \n6th \n9 \n3rd \n5 \n7th \n10 \n4th \n6 \n8th \n11 \n9th \n13 \n"},

It helps define the character's place in the \nworld, rather than what a character is in terms of game \nmechanics. \nInstead of focusing on a generic character \nbackground, such as merchant or wanderer, think \nabout the factions, organizations, and cultures of \nyour campaign and how they might be leveraged to \ncreate flavorful backgrounds for player characters. For \nexample, you could create an acolyte of Candlekeep \nbackground that is functionally similar to a sage \nbackground, but which ties a character more closely to a \nplace and organization in your world. \nA character with the acolyte of Candlekeep \nbackground probably has friends among the \nAvowed-the monks who maintain the great library \nat Candlekeep. The character can enter the library \nand consult its lore freely, while others must donate \na rare or valuable tome of knowledge before they are \nallowed entry. Candlekeep's enemies are the character's \nenemies, and its allies, the character's friends. Acolytes \nof Candlekeep are generally regarded as learned sages \nand protectors of knowledge. It's possible to envision \nmany interesting interactions as NPCs discover the \ncharacter's background and approach the character in \nsearch of assistance. \nTo create your own background, follow these steps. \nSTEP 1. ROOT lT IN YOUR WORLD \nTo ground a new background in your campaign's \nsetting, determine what element of your campaign the \nbackground is tied to: a faction. an organization, a trade, \na person, an event, or a location. \nSTEP 2. SUGGEST P ERSO NAL CHARACTERISTICS \nCreate tables of suggested characteristics-personality \ntraits, ideals, bonds, and flaws-that fit the background, \nor plunder entries from the tables presented in the \nPlayer's Handbook. Even if your players don't use \nthe tables, this step helps you paint a picture of the \nbackground's place in your world. The tables need not \nbe extensive; two or three entries per table are enough. \nSTEP 3. ASSIGN PROFICIENCIES OR LANGUAGES \nChoose two skill proficiencies and two tool proficiencies \nfor the background. You can replace tool proficiencies \nwith languages on a one-for-one basis. \nSTEP 4'. INCLUDE STARTING EQUIPMENT \nMake sure your background offers a package of starting \nequipment. In addition to a small amount of money that \na character can use to buy adventuring gear, the starting \nequipment should include items that a character would \nhave acquired prior to becoming an adventurer, as well \nas one or two items unique to the background. \nFor example, starting equipment for a character with \nthe acolyte of Candlekeep background might include a \nset of traveler's clothes, a scholar's robe, five candles, \na tinderbox, an empty scroll case engraved with the \nsymbol of Candlekeep, and a belt pouch containing 10 \ngp. The scroll case might be a gift given to an acolyte of \nCandlekeep who embarks on a life of adventure. At your \ndiscretion, it might also contain a useful map. \nSTEP 5. SETTLE ON A BACKGROUND FEATURE \nChoose an existing background feature or create a new \none, as you prefer. If you choose an existing feature, add \nor tweak a few details to make it unique. \nFor example, the acolyte of Candlekeep background \nmight have the Researcher feature of the sage (as \npresented in the Player's Handbook), with the additional \nbenefit that the character is allowed to enter Candlekeep \nwithout paying the normal cost. \nA background feature should avoid strict game \nbenefits, such as a bonus to an ability check or an attack \nroll. Instead, the feature should open up new options for \nroleplaying, exploring, and otherwise interacting with \nthe world. \nFor example, the sage's Researcher feature is \ndesigned to send the character on adventures. It doesn't \nprovide information or an automatic success for a check. \nInstead, if a character with the sage background fails \nto recall information, he or she instead knows where to \nlearn it. This might be a pointer to another sage or to a \nlibrary long lost within an ancient tomb. \nThe best background features give characters \na reason to strike out on quests, to make contact \nwith NPCs, and to develop bonds to the setting \nyou've devised. \nCHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP \n"},

One you have initial passages and \ndoors, determine the location and nature of \nsubsequent passages, doors, chambers, stairs, and so \non- each of them generated by rolls on different tables. \nFollowing these instructions can lead to sprawling \ncomplexes that more than fill a single sheet of graph \npaper.

  'text': 'CHAMBER CONTENTS \nOnce you have a sense of the purpose of the various \ndungeon chambers, you can think about the contents \nof those areas. The Dungeon Chamber Contents table \nallows you to randomly roll contents for a chamber, or \nyou can choose contents for specific areas. If you choose \ncontents, be sure to include an interesting, colorful \nassortment of things. In addition to the contents shown \non this table, refer to "Dungeon Dressing" later in this \nappendix for additional items and elements to fill rooms. \nIn the Dungeon Chamber Contents table, a "dominant \ninhabitant" is a creature that controls an area. Pets \nand allied creatures are subservient to the dominant \ninhabitant. "Random creatures" are scavengers or \nnuisances, usually lone monsters or small groups \npassing through the area. They include such creatures \nas carrion crawlers, dire rats, gelatinous cubes, and rust \nmonsters. See chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," for \nmore information on random encounters. \nDUNGEON CHAMBER CONTENTS \ndlOO \n01-08 \n09-15 \n16-27 \n28-33 \n34-42 \n43-50 \n51-58 \n59-63 \n64-73 \n74-76 \n77-80 \nContents \nMonster (dominant inhabitant) \nMonster (dominant inhabitant) with treasure \nMonster (pet or allied creature) \nMonster (pet or allied creature) guarding treasure \nMonster (random creature) \nMonster (random creature) with treasure \nDungeon hazard (see "Random Dungeon \nHazards") with incidental treasure \nObstacle (see "Random Obstacles") \nTrap (see "Random Traps") \nTrap (see "Random Traps") protecting treasure \nTrick (see "Random Tricks") \n81-88 \nEmpty room \n89-94 \nEmpty room with dungeon hazard (see "Random \nDungeon Hazards") \n95-00 \nEmpty room with treasure \nMONSTERS AND MOTIVATIONS \nSee chapter 3, "Creating Adventures," for guidance on \ncreating encounters with monsters. To foster variety \nand suspense, be sure to include encounters of varying \ndifficulty. \nA powerful creature encountered early in the dungeon \nsets an exciting tone and forces the adventurers to \nrely on their wits. For example, an ancient red dragon \nAPPENDIX A I RANDOM DUNGEONS \nmight slumber on the first level of a dungeon, a pall of \nsmoke and the sound of its heavy breathing filling the \nchambers near its lair. Clever characters will do their \nutmost to avoid the dragon, even as the party\'s brave \nthief makes off with a few coins from its hoard. \nNot all monsters are automatically hostile. When \nplacing monsters in your dungeon, consider their \nrelationships to nearby creatures and their attitudes \ntoward adventurers. Characters might be able to \nappease a hungry beast by offering it food, and smarter \ncreatures have complex motivations. The Monster \nMotivation table lets you use a monster\'s goals to define \nits presence in the dungeon. \nFor large groups of monsters encountered across \nmultiple chambers, motivation could apply to the entire \ngroup, or each subgroup could have conflicting goals. \nMONSTER MOTIVATION \nd20 \nGoals \nd20 \nGoals \n1-2 \nFind a sanctuary \n12-13 \nHide from \n3-5 \nConquer the \nenemies \ndungeon \n14-15 \nRecover from a \n6-8 \nSeek an item in \nbattle \nthe dungeon \n16-17 \nAvoid danger \n9-11 \nSlay a rival \n18-20 \nSeek wealth \nRANDOM DUNGEON HAZARDS \nHazards are rarely found in inhabited areas, because \nmonsters either clear them away or avoid them. \nShriekers and violet fungi are described in the \nMonster Manual. The other hazards on the table are \ndescribed in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments." \nDUNGEON HAZARDS \nd20 \nHazard \nd20 \nHazard \n1-3 \nBrown mold \n11-15 \nSpiderwebs \n4-8 \nGreen slime \n16-17 \nViolet fungus \n9-10 \nShrieker \n18-20 \nYellow mold \nRANDOM OBSTACLES \nObstacles block progress through the dungeon. In some \ncases, what adventurers consider an obstacle is an \neasy path for the dungeon\'s inhabitants. For example, \na flooded chamber is a barrier to many characters but \neasily navigated by water-breathing creatures. \nObstacles can affect more than one room. A chasm \nmight run through several passages and chambers, \nor send cracks through the stonework in a wider area \naround it. An area of battering winds that emanates \nfrom a magic altar could stir the air less dangerously for \nhundreds of feet in all directions. \n'},
